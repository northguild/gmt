# GMT: Give Me Temporal

Home of [@northguild/gmt](./packages/gmt) — **Give Me Temporal!**

A monorepo for NorthGuild community libraries, focused on making JavaScript date handling reliable and predictable.

Head to our [docs site](https://gmt-dox.northguild.workers.dev/) for the best way to get started.

**Why GMT:**

- **100% Temporal, Temporal-first.** GMT is built directly on the TC39 `Temporal` standard (via `@js-temporal/polyfill`) — not a custom, homegrown date/time type system like `@internationalized/date`'s own `CalendarDate`/`ZonedDateTime` classes. No `Date` object anywhere, enforced by 3 dedicated lint packages.
- **A full replacement for any and all of them.** Luxon, date-fns, Moment.js, and react-aria's `@internationalized/date` don't have parity with each other — GMT covers the combined capabilities of all four in one library, plus what none of them do alone.
- **~15× more CI test executions than all four competitors combined**: 334,020 (16,701 tests × 17 locales × 10 timezones × 2 Node versions) vs. their combined 20,190.
- **~40× more test cases than `@internationalized/date`**: 16,701 vs. 386 — Adobe's own library, run at its own commit.
- **The only one of the five that tests systematically across locales in CI at all.** Zero of the four comparison libraries run a locale-test matrix; GMT mandates all 17 locales on every locale-aware function.
- **The only one that runs its entire suite under a real `TZ` env var across real-world zones.** Luxon and `@internationalized/date` have no CI timezone matrix; date-fns's zone scope is unclear; Moment.js covers 6 zones but not its full suite.
- **Explicit DST disambiguation control on both construction _and_ arithmetic** — a control none of the others expose.
- **The only actively-maintained one that's Temporal-native.** Moment.js is officially in maintenance mode; Luxon, date-fns, and `@internationalized/date` are still active but all still depend on `Date` internally.

## Agent prompt

```
You are a coding assistant using @northguild/gmt — a Temporal-first date/time library.

SETUP (do this once per project):

1. Install the runtime:
   npm install @northguild/gmt

2. (Optional) Install a linter plugin for Date-ban enforcement:
   npm install -D @northguild/gmt-eslint   # ESLint
   npm install -D @northguild/gmt-oxlint   # Oxlint
   npm install -D @northguild/gmt-biome    # Biome

3. Wire TanStack Intent so skill guidance is discoverable in AGENTS.md:
   npx @tanstack/intent@latest install

WHEN HELPING THE USER:

1. Ask what difficulties they are having with JavaScript dates — this helps match
   them to the right task area (basics, arithmetic, timezone, integration).

2. Generate code using GMT's string-in/string-out API. NEVER use new Date().
   Read the installed package's README.md and source JSDoc for API details.

3. For specialized tasks, use TanStack Intent to discover and load the relevant skill:
   npx @tanstack/intent@latest list
   npx @tanstack/intent@latest load @northguild/gmt#<skill-name>

NOTE: @northguild/gmt ships consumer and contributor skills. Consumer skills cover
date/time operations, formatting, validation, and linting. Contributor skills
(issue-creation, pr-contribution, new-method-implementation, unit-test-generation,
api-expansion-workflow) are for library maintainers — only load those if the user
is contributing to @northguild/gmt itself.
```

## Install

Install the runtime package:

| Package manager | Command                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| npm             | `npm install @northguild/gmt` |
| yarn            | `yarn add @northguild/gmt`    |
| pnpm            | `pnpm add @northguild/gmt`    |
| bun             | `bun add @northguild/gmt`     |

Quick example:

```js
import { getNow } from "@northguild/gmt";
console.log(getNow()); // ISO 8601 string
```

## Why not JavaScript Date objects

We do not use JavaScript `Date` APIs in this monorepo.

- `new Date()` introduces mutability and environment drift.
- `Date.parse()` relies on ambiguous, engine-dependent parsing.
- `Date.UTC()` requires awkward positional arguments.
- `Date.now()` scatters untyped timestamps throughout code.

Use GMT instead:

- `getNow()`, `getUnixNow()`, and `getUtcNow()` for current time values.
- `convertUtcDateTimeToUnix()` and `convertUtcToUnix()` for explicit unix conversion.
- `convertTimezoneToUtc()` and `convertUtcToTimezone()` for timezone-safe conversion.
- String-in/string-out APIs with Temporal under the hood for safer behavior.

If you see a Date API in code, replace it with a GMT helper.

## Packages

| Package                             | npm                           | Description                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| [`@northguild/gmt`](./packages/gmt) | `npm install @northguild/gmt` | Give Me Temporal — string-in/string-out date library |

`@northguild/gmt` currently exports top-level `Temporal`, `duration`, `plain`, `precision`, `span`, `zoned`, `unix`, `utc`, and `regex` namespaces, with direct subpath imports available under `@northguild/gmt/*`.

### How GMT is tested, vs. the libraries it targets

GMT is measured directly against react-aria's **`@internationalized/date`**, **Luxon**, **date-fns**, and **Moment.js** — the same four libraries compared below. All numbers were verified **2026-08-22** against the exact package versions/commits below — nothing is estimated. Re-verify before citing these numbers elsewhere; library surfaces and CI configs move.

| Library                   | Version tested                          |

<sub>Methodology: "Test files" and the CI/maintenance rows come from each project's public CI configuration and repository file listing. "Individual test cases" for GMT, Luxon, date-fns, and Moment.js were obtained by actually cloning the repo at the commit above, installing dependencies, running the project's own test command (`vitest run` / `jest` / `node scripts/test.js`), and reading that runner's own final summary — not grepped from source. `@internationalized/date` was run by cloning `adobe/react-spectrum` at `5d191ab`, installing dependencies, and executing `npx jest packages/@internationalized/date/tests/`, yielding 386 passing tests. Luxon (39 failures) and date-fns (46 failures) had environment-dependent local failures that don't affect the total count: Luxon's suite assumes its CI container's local time zone is `America/New_York`; date-fns's experimental native-`Temporal` code path needs a global `Temporal` Node doesn't yet provide natively. Moment.js passed cleanly (0 failed) on Node 24.

### Testing strategy

GMT's test suite balances **thoroughness** against **maintenance burden** by testing behavior, not permutations.

**What we test exhaustively:**

- **17-locale matrix** — every locale-aware function is exercised across all 17 `MustTestLocales` (en-US, en-GB, de-DE, fr-FR, es-ES, it-IT, pt-PT, sv-SE, zh-CN, zh-TW, ja-JP, ko-KR, ar-SA, he-IL, ru-RU, tr-TR, is-IS). This covers script direction, first-day-of-week differences, and calendar metadata.
- **Timezone battle matrix** — every zoned function is exercised across 10 IANA timezones spanning every UTC offset band from Pacific/Niue (−11:00) to Pacific/Apia (+14:00), including DST-transition and half-hour-offset zones.
- **Zero-length and identity cases** — every interval and arithmetic function is tested with zero-length inputs, identity operations, and boundary-adjacent values.
- **Invalid-input sentinels** — every public function is tested for the documented fallback behavior (`""`, `null`, `false`, `[]`) on malformed strings, wrong types, leap seconds, and inverted intervals.

**What we collapse:**

- **Non-string input tables** — functions that guard with `typeof x !== "string"` return the same sentinel for `null`, `undefined`, `123`, `true`, `[]`, and `{}`. We test one representative non-string per argument position rather than all six types × N positions. The collapse is safe because all non-string types hit the identical early-return code path.
- **Redundant permutations** — adjacent/disjoint/reversed interval cases that produce identical results are not duplicated across every function variant. The `plain/`, `zoned/`, `utc/`, and `unix/` families share the same mathematical behavior; each family gets the minimum set of cases needed to prove correctness.

**Result:** 16,701 tests across 552 files that exercise real behavior differences without redundant permutations. The suite runs in CI as 334,020 executions (16,701 × 2 Node versions × 10 timezones).

### Feature parity

GMT has **full functional parity** with all four comparison libraries, capability for capability — with several areas where GMT goes further than any of them.

| Capability                                                                                   | Status                       | Also has it                                                              |
