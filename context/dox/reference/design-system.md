# Dox theme — architecture & maintenance

> The visual language itself (palette intent, "maximal chrome, disciplined content

> *implementation*.

How `apps/dox`'s theme is put together, and the rules for changing it without
making a mess.

## The stylesheet stack

The theme is plain CSS custom properties — **no Tailwind, no `@layer`**. It beats
Starlight's defaults by being unlayered (unlayered always wins over `@layer`).
**One exception:** `DOX-C0` (#171) scopes Tailwind v4 to the chat island for AI
Elements. It never touches these sheets, and the rules that keep it contained are in
"Tailwind in the chat island" below.
Eight files, loaded in this order via `starlight({ customCss })` in
`apps/dox/astro.config.mjs`:

| # | File | Owns |
| - | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | `gmt-tokens.css` | The palette (6 roles), every `--gmt-*` token, the `@font-face`, and the `[data-theme="light"]` value block. **Custom properties only — no selectors.** |
| 2 | `gmt-theme.css` | Maps `--gmt-*` onto Starlight's `--sl-*` system (+ a 3-line light override for the non-palette literals). Theming Starlight's built-ins happens here. |
| 3 | `gmt-primitives.css` | Reusable, Starlight-agnostic recipe classes: `.gmt-glass` / `-subtle` / `-clear` / `-heavy`, `.gmt-brackets`, `.gmt-icon-button`. **Compose from these in widgets.** |
| 4 | `gmt-glass.css` | The glass treatment applied to Starlight's own elements (header, sidebar, `pre`, tables, asides, cards, search, dialogs). |
| 5 | `gmt-shell.css` | Global typography + the layout frame (`.page`, sidebar, header, site title). |
| 6 | `gmt-content.css` | The reading surface: everything inside `.sl-markdown-content`, Expressive Code frame chrome, the search modal / Pagefind UI. |
| 7 | `gmt-controls.css` | Interactive chrome: CTA buttons, prev/next pagination, mobile search trigger, hamburger, `:focus-visible`, `::selection`, scrollbar. |
| 8 | `gmt-light.css` | The `[data-theme="light"]` overrides that are neither a palette re-tint nor adjacent to a base rule. **Not actually loaded last** — `dox.css` (live component layout) and `gmt-a11y.css` (`prefers-reduced-transparency`/`-contrast`/`forced-colors`) both load after it in `astro.config.mjs`'s `customCss` array; this table's numbering is source-order, not "wins every tie." |
| 9 | `gmt-ask.css` | **DOX-C0, #171 — not yet built.** The chat dock/`/dox` chrome and the Streamdown reading surface (`[data-streamdown="…"]`). No Tailwind. |

The `customCss` array in `astro.config.mjs` also carries per-widget and per-feature
sheets (`gmt-widget.css`, `gmt-clock-list.css`, `gmt-map.css`, `gmt-globe.css`,
`gmt-scrubber.css`, `gmt-dst-inspector.css`, …) loaded between #7 and #8, with
`gmt-clock-list.css` registered before `gmt-map.css`/`gmt-globe.css`/`gmt-scrubber.css`
since it's now the shared `.gmt-clock-*` row recipe all three widgets sit on top of.
This table describes the **core stack** whose order the cascade depends on; consult
the config for the full list. (`gmt-hero.css` — extracting `HeroGlobe.astro`'s
`.gmt-herostage*` out of its current `@layer starlight.core` — was scoped for `DOX-E1`
but not done; still pending, tracked only here, not as a separate issue.)

Component-scoped `<style>` blocks stay in their `.astro` files
(`Hero`, `LinkButton`, `ButtonLink`, `Icon`, `SocialIcons`, `ThemeSelect`) — the
idiomatic Starlight override pattern. They consume the tokens/primitives above;
they don't redefine them.

## Tokens

**Palette** — 6 roles (`--gmt-void / cyan / spring / teal / ice / signal`), each
re-tinted in the `[data-theme="light"]` block. Everything else derives from these.

**Glass scale** — named stand-ins for the teal/cyan `color(from … / <alpha>)`
washes, so alphas aren't magic numbers sprinkled through every rule:

- fills (teal-derived): `--gmt-fill-subtle` `.06` · `--gmt-fill` `.08` · `--gmt-fill-2` `.10` · `--gmt-fill-strong` `.12` · `--gmt-fill-deep` `.15`
- borders (cyan-derived): `--gmt-border` `.18` · `--gmt-border-strong` `.35` · `--gmt-hairline-faint` `.08`
- `--gmt-glow` (box-shadow), `--gmt-highlight` / `--gmt-highlight-faint` (inset top line)
- `--gmt-signal-fill` / `--gmt-signal-border` (caution aside)
- `--gmt-scrollbar-track` / `-thumb` / `-thumb-hover`

`--gmt-glass-tint` / `-subtle` / `-scrim` are **separate** from `--gmt-fill-*`:
they get *extra* alpha in light mode to compensate for the brighter light-mode
teal ("light-compensated"). Don't merge the two sets.

**Theme-role tokens** — `--gmt-code-surface`, `--gmt-code-bg`, `--gmt-code-border`,
`--gmt-sidebar-link`, `--gmt-pagination-title`. Each resolves to a *different
token* in dark vs light (not just a re-tint), so the rule that uses it needs no
`[data-theme="light"]` block.

## Maintenance rules

1. **Never add a `[data-theme="light"]` block for a color.** If a value differs
   between themes, either it's a palette re-tint (already handled — just use the
   `--gmt-*` token) or it needs a new **theme-role token**: define it in `:root`
   and again in the light block in `gmt-tokens.css`, then use `var(--gmt-role)` in
   the rule. A `[data-theme="light"]` rule is only acceptable for a genuine
   non-color effect change (a `backdrop-filter`, a `::-webkit-scrollbar` tweak) —
   and it goes in `gmt-light.css` unless a base rule for the same selector lives
   elsewhere, in which case keep it adjacent.
2. **No color literals in rules.** Every fill/border/glow goes through a `--gmt-*`
   token. One-off gradient stops that appear once are the only exception.
3. **Widgets compose primitives.** New interactive widgets (DOX-B) use
   `.gmt-glass*` / `.gmt-brackets` / `.gmt-icon-button` and the token scale — they
   should not need to touch any Starlight-override sheet.
4. **Respect the file order.** The cascade depends on the `customCss` order above.
   Moving a rule between files can change which of two equal-specificity rules
   wins. If you split or reorder, verify with a screenshot diff (see below).
5. **Don't introduce `@layer` into the GMT sheets.** The whole system relies on being
   unlayered, and that is what lets it beat Starlight's defaults. `DOX-C0` (#171) brings
   Tailwind v4 in for the chat island, and Tailwind emits
   `@layer theme, base, components, utilities`. That is allowed **only** under the
   constraints in the next section. The GMT sheets themselves stay unlayered.

## Tailwind in the chat island (DOX-C0, #171)

AI Elements requires Tailwind CSS 4. It is scoped to the chat island and **must not reach
any other page**. Four constraints make that true; all four are `DOX-C0` DoD items.

1. **Omit Preflight.** Tailwind's reset targets `*`, `html`, `body` and headings and would
   wreck the docs. Import the layers individually — the documented v4 opt-out:

   ```css
   @layer theme, base, components, utilities;
   @import "tailwindcss/theme.css" layer(theme);
   /* preflight.css deliberately NOT imported */
   @import "tailwindcss/utilities.css" layer(utilities);
   ```

2. **Import that sheet from the React island's entry module, never from `customCss`.**
   Vite then code-splits it into the island's own chunk, so a page that never opens the
   chat never loads it.

3. **Know which way the cascade falls.** Tailwind utilities are in `@layer utilities`;
   these sheets are unlayered, and unlayered always wins. **So every GMT rule beats every
   Tailwind utility.** Only three groups of global element selectors exist in these sheets
   — the list to re-check rather than re-derive:

   | Selector | File | What it sets |
   | -------- | ---- | ------------ |
   | `h1`–`h6` | `gmt-shell.css` | font-family, letter-spacing — hits markdown headings in replies |
   | `textarea`, `input:not([type=checkbox\|radio\|range])` | `gmt-controls.css` | hits the composer and every AI Elements input |
   | `body` | `gmt-shell.css` | not applicable inside the panel |

   Ship a scoped `.gmt-ask` reset for the two that apply.

4. **Bridge, don't fork, the palette.** Map shadcn's variables (`--background`,
   `--foreground`, `--primary`, `--muted`, `--border`, `--ring`, …) onto the `--gmt-*`
   tokens. Rule 1 still applies: no `[data-theme="light"]` color blocks — add a theme-role
   token instead.

The Streamdown reading surface needs **no Tailwind at all**: style it in `gmt-ask.css`
through `[data-streamdown="heading-1"|"link"|"code-block"|"table"|"blockquote"|…]`.

## Verifying a change is visually safe

A Playwright screenshot diff is the gate, via `apps/dox/scripts/visual-snapshot.mjs`
(added in `DOX-E1`'s part-2 branch). From `apps/dox`, before touching any CSS:

```sh
pnpm build && pnpm visual:before   # captures .visual/before/<page>-<theme>-<viewport>.png
# ... make the change ...
pnpm build && pnpm visual:after    # captures .visual/after/... for the same page/theme/viewport set
```

Fixed page list: `/` (hero), `/install` (dense reference page, zero islands),
`/tools/zoned-earth`, `/tools/zone-planner`, one Tier-2/3 teaching-widget page. Both
`data-theme="dark"`/`"light"`, both desktop (`1440×900`) and mobile (`390×844`)
viewports. `.visual/` is git-ignored — the baseline lives only in the local working
tree for the duration of one work session, not committed. Eyeball the before/after
pairs; a full `playwright test` diff runner isn't needed for this.

```sh
pnpm check && pnpm lint && pnpm test
```

A pure refactor (renames, file moves, role-token swaps) must produce a
**byte-identical** screenshot set. Any diff is a regression unless it's the exact
change you intended, confined to the region you touched.
