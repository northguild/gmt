# EPIC — Dox: the documentation site for `@northguild/gmt`

> This directory follows the same progressive-disclosure structure as
> `context/roadmap/`. Start at [index.md](index.md). This file (overview.md) is the
> **architecture** map — context, decisions, hosting, prior-art verdicts, and the
> tier table. The deep sections live in [`reference/`](reference/); load them only when
> the story needs them.
>
> This is a **documentation site first** — real URLs, indexable, linkable, usable from
> Tier 0 — and a larger ambition (interactive globe, live widget on every example, a
> mentor-voiced scenario layer, a chat that mounts widgets) layered on top. Tier 6 is
> built on [AI Elements](https://elements.ai-sdk.dev/) and the AI SDK, with a foundation
> story (`DOX-C0`) and two chat surfaces: a draggable dock on every page **and** a
> dedicated `/dox` route.

## 1. Context and the ordering principle

See [`reference/verified-findings.md`](reference/verified-findings.md) for the raw
material (504 functions, 1,860 examples, 42 public types), the verified findings that
shaped the plan (exports map, empty tag graph, Astro 7 Node floor, etc.), and the real
generator risk. Counts in that file **drift**; `DOX-A3a` re-derives them from source.

## 2. Architecture

```text
apps/dox/                  Astro 7 + @astrojs/starlight 0.41 — a real multi-page site
  ├── astro.config.mjs
  ├── wrangler.jsonc                  assets binding → dist/; /api/* once C exists
  ├── scripts/build-reference.ts      TS compiler API → generated MDX + corpus + manifest
  ├── worker/                         same deployment — holds the model API key (Tier 6)
  └── src/
      ├── content.config.ts           docsLoader() + docsSchema()
      ├── content/docs/
      │   ├── index.mdx               landing page (globe hero, Tier 4)
      │   ├── guides/                 hand-curated (README, skills, DST doc)
      │   ├── scenarios/              mentor layer — real-world tasks (Tier 5)
      │   └── reference/              GENERATED, gitignored — one page per function
      ├── components/                 Playground + purpose-built widgets, chat panel
      └── styles/                     token layer, then the HUD theme
```

**One deployment, not two.** A single Cloudflare Worker serves the built site through an
`assets` binding and — once Tier 6 exists — handles `/api/*` in the same isolate. Through
Tier 5 the Worker has no `main` at all: it is assets-only, with
`not_found_handling: "404-page"`. See "Hosting" below for why this matters more than it
looks.

**Data flow.** One build step, three consumers. `build-reference.ts` walks
`packages/gmt/src` with the TypeScript compiler API and emits:

- **(a)** one MDX page per exported function into the Starlight content collection;
- **(b)** `gmt-corpus.json` — the same content as retrieval chunks, each carrying the URL
  of the page it came from;
- **(c)** a **route manifest** — the set of every URL (a) produced;

The site is built from (a). `llms-full.txt` is built from (b), and so is retrieval if
Tier 6 lands. Every link is validated against (c) — at build time as a link check, and at
runtime against anything a model emits, so a hallucinated citation renders as plain text
rather than a 404 (see "Citation integrity" below). Tier 2's auto-embedded playgrounds use
`LIVE_PLAYGROUND_TEMPLATES` — a raw call-string template per function that seeds the
textarea with a starting expression.

That shared artifact is the load-bearing idea: the corpus, the site, the AI surface and
the playground templates are all the same extraction, which means they cannot drift.

Widgets run the **real** library — `apps/dox` depends on `@northguild/gmt` via
`workspace:*`, so a playground's output is never simulated and can never drift from
shipped behavior.

### Decisions taken

| Page granularity   | **One page per function**, as date-fns and Luxon do — exact-match search titles, and a stable URL to cite                                         |
| Nav                | Starlight `autogenerate: { directory: 'reference' }` over the generated tree                                                                      |
| Import granularity | **Module barrels only** (`@northguild/gmt/plain/calculate`). Never namespace — see §1                                                             |

| **Widgets**        | **Live on every example** via a simple textarea island — type a JS expression, run the real library, see the result. No URL state, no permalinks. |
| **3D**             | **Interactive globe** — click a zone, read live time, offset and DST state. A product feature, not decoration                                     |
| **Chat stack**     | **AI Elements + the AI SDK** — a shadcn registry, source copied in. 12 components, not 48                                                         |
| **Chat rendering** | **Streamdown** — streaming markdown, shiki code blocks with copy, `[data-streamdown]` CSS hooks                                                   |
| **React**          | **Introduced in `DOX-C0` (#171)**, scoped to the chat island. No other page hydrates React                                                        |

### Hosting — why one origin, not two

Splitting the site onto GitHub Pages and the chat onto a separate Cloudflare Worker would
buy, for nothing: an explicit CORS allowlist, a `Vary: Origin` header, two deploy
pipelines, an origin-mismatch failure mode, and an open question of where the corpus
lives at runtime.

A single Worker with an `assets` binding removes all of it. `/api/chat` is same-origin, so
there is no CORS at all; there is one pipeline; and the Worker can fetch the corpus from
the very site it is serving, with no extra hop and no staleness coupling.

**GitHub Pages is not enabled on this repo** (`gh api repos/northguild/gmt/pages` → 404),
so there is nothing to migrate away from. A Cloudflare account is a hard dependency for
_deployment_, not merely for chat — that is the one real cost of this decision and it is
recorded in
[`reference/verification-and-risks.md`](reference/verification-and-risks.md).

**Use `pnpm` for all install and registry commands.**

### Reviewed prior art — the Worktree CLI docs site

`reference/prior-art/worktree-cli-snapshot-2026-08-21.md` documents how a sibling
`@northguild/worktree` repo built its docs site and AI chat. It is a working system and
**an example, not a target** — its own warning notes it lacks a real textarea, multiline
chat, and copyable code blocks, and it does not meet this project's design or functional
needs.

What was taken from it, and what was deliberately not:

The deepest idea worth restating, because it is the same principle DOX-A3a already runs on:
**generate, don't maintain — one source of truth, now four consumers** (pages, AI surface,
playground templates, retrieval).

### Citation integrity — a structural guarantee, not a test

A test that "every citation must resolve" only samples; it cannot cover what a model
emits at runtime. Instead: derive a route allowlist from the same filesystem scan that
produces the pages, ship it to the client, and run **every** href the model emits through
a resolver. A link that is not in the allowlist renders as plain text instead of a broken
link.

That is a structural guarantee rather than a hope, and it costs almost nothing here
because DOX-A3a already knows every route it generated. **DOX-A3a emits a route manifest
as a third artifact.** A sampling test still runs, but it is no longer the only thing
standing between a reader and a 404.

**The manifest now has three consumers, not one**, which is why it earns its place in
Tier 0 even though the chat is in Tier 6:

- **DOX-A3a itself** — a build-time link check asserting the manifest exactly equals the set
  of pages generated. A manifest that has drifted from reality is worse than no manifest:
  it would silently suppress valid links and admit dead ones.
- **DOX-A3b** — `llms.txt` and every per-page raw `.md` route are emitted from the same URL
  set, so the AI surface cannot point at a page that does not exist.
- **DOX-C3a** — runtime hardening of anything a model emits.

Note the ordering consequence: because the manifest ships in Tier 0, none of the later
tiers has to reconstruct it, and Tier 6 can be dropped entirely without losing it.

## 3. Visual design language

See [`reference/visual-design.md`](reference/visual-design.md) for the language spec
(palette, typography, glass, animated borders, chamfer, controls, widget chrome, motion,
performance notes). Implementation rules live in
[`reference/design-system.md`](reference/design-system.md) — load that when actually
styling components.

---

## 4. Workspace integration (do first — four files, easy to miss)

See [`reference/workspace-integration.md`](reference/workspace-integration.md). Load
**only on `DOX-A1`** — every other story consumes the result. Covers
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, root `package.json`, `oxlint.config.js`, `apps/dox/package.json`,
and the `tsconfig.base.json` / `customConditions` constraints.

## 5. Work breakdown

**23 units of work across 7 tiers, mapped onto 14 GitHub issues (#130–#142 plus #171 for
`DOX-C0`).** New work normally enters as a lettered sub-story on the issue it naturally
belongs to (`DOX-A3a`/`DOX-A3b`, `DOX-B2a`–`DOX-B2d`, …), the same pattern
`context/roadmap/` used for `J0a`/`J0b`. Sub-story IDs are for planning legibility only;
GitHub still tracks work at the issue level.

**`DOX-C0` (#171) is the one story with its own issue rather than a sub-story slot.** The
React + Tailwind + AI Elements foundation is infrastructure rather than chat, it touches
every existing page's build, and it is reviewable before any chat behavior exists. It
blocks all four other Tier 6 stories.

| 5    | `DOX-A4b`–`d` — scenario template, ported pitfalls, mentor index                                                        | The real-world teaching layer                        |
| 6    | `DOX-C0` foundation, then `DOX-C1`–`DOX-C3a`/`b` — retrieval, Worker, dock + `/dox`, widget registry                    | **The chat that mounts widgets**                     |

**Tier 0 is order-locked and is the only hard sequencing constraint.** `DOX-A1` → `DOX-A2`
→ `DOX-A3a` must land in that order so every later tier is visible on a live site. **Tier 1
onward may be reordered**, and **Tier 5 (scenarios) may run in parallel with Tiers 2–4**
once `DOX-B1a` exists, since its content-writing skill profile does not compete with the
component work in Tiers 2–4. Each story is independently verifiable; do not start the next
sub-story on an issue until the current one's Definition of Done passes.

**Three issues span more than one tier:** `#132` (`DOX-A3`, Tier 0 + 1), `#133`
(`DOX-A4`, Tier 1 + 5), and `#136` (`DOX-B2`, Tier 2). **An issue closes when its last
sub-story lands, not its first** — see [tracker.md](tracker.md).

**Tier 6 has one internal ordering constraint:** `DOX-C0` (#171) must land before any of
`DOX-C1`, `DOX-C2`, `DOX-C3a` or `DOX-C3b` starts — they all assume React, Tailwind and
the AI Elements components exist.

Unlike `context/roadmap/`, these stories do **not** publish to npm — `apps/dox` is
private. No changesets are needed unless a story also modifies `packages/gmt`.
