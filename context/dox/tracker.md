## GitHub Issues

The 23 sub-stories map onto 14 GitHub issues — #130–#142, plus **#171 for `DOX-C0`**. Each
issue appears once below; its `Story` column lists every sub-story that folds into it.
Start a branch by naming the sub-story ID (e.g. `DOX-A3a`) — the agent resolves it to the
issue number here and the full spec in `issues/<letter>.md`.

**#171 (`DOX-C0`) is the one story with its own issue** rather than a sub-story slot: the
React + Tailwind + AI Elements foundation is infrastructure rather than chat, it touches
every existing page's build, and it is independently reviewable before any chat behavior
exists. **It blocks all four other Tier 6 stories.**

`Order` is the sequence to actually build these in. It follows overview.md §5:

- **Tier 0 is the MVP and is order-locked.** `DOX-A1` → `DOX-A2` → `DOX-A3a` must land in
  that sequence so every later tier is visible on a live site from the start.
- **Tier 1 onward may be reordered freely.**
- **Tier 5 (scenarios) may run in parallel with Tiers 2–4** once `DOX-B1a` exists — it is
  content work with a different skill profile and does not compete with component work.

**An issue closes when its last sub-story lands, not its first.** Do not close #132 when
`DOX-A3a` ships — `DOX-A3b` is still open against it in Tier 1. Same for #133. The
single-story issues (#130, #131, #134, #140, #141, #171, #137, #138) close on their only
sub-story.

**No changesets, no publish column.** `apps/dox` is private and is not published to
npm, so unlike `context/roadmap/`, these stories do not need a `.changeset/*.md` entry —
with one exception: if a story also modifies `packages/gmt` (for example `DOX-A3a`
deciding to stub the namespace READMEs, per overview.md §7), that change follows the
normal repo convention and does need a changeset.

¹ Every DoD item buildable outside Tier 6 is done — see the "Status" notes in
`issues/DOX-E.md`. The one item that can't close yet is `DOX-E1a` rendering in the
`/dox` widget rail, which can't exist before Tier 6 (`DOX-C3a`/`DOX-C3b`) builds that
rail. `initGlobe`/the scrubber's `mount`-shaped entry points are already rail-ready —
see the pickup note in `issues/DOX-C.md`.

Parked work carries no story ID and never enters this table — see
[appendix-parked.md](appendix-parked.md).
