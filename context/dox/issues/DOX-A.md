# Issue #130–#134 — Ship the site, its AI surface, and the scenario layer

These five issues carry nine sub-stories across three tiers: `DOX-A1`/`DOX-A2`/`DOX-A3a`
are Tier 0 (the MVP), `DOX-A5`/`DOX-A4a`/`DOX-A3b` are Tier 1, and `DOX-A4b`–`d` are
Tier 5 (the real-world scenario layer). `DOX-A3b` folds into #132 alongside `DOX-A3a`,
and `DOX-A4b`–`d` fold into #133 alongside `DOX-A4a`. See tracker.md for the full mapping
and the note on issues that span more than one tier.

Each issue below is one logical unit; its sub-stories are nested under it and ordered as
they should be built. The issue stays open until its last sub-story lands.

After Tier 0's three stories (`DOX-A1`, `DOX-A2`, `DOX-A3a`), `@northguild/gmt` has a real,
deployed, searchable, linkable documentation site covering all 504 functions. Nothing in
Tier 1 onward is required for that to be true, and any of it can be dropped or reordered
without losing the docs.

## Definition of done — binding for every story in this file

- `pnpm run validate` stays green, **including the 20-cell
  GMT timezone matrix**. `apps/dox` must not perturb `packages/gmt`.
- No changeset is needed — `apps/dox` is private and unpublished. The one exception is
  a story that also modifies `packages/gmt` (see `DOX-A3a`'s namespace-README decision),
  which follows the normal repo convention.
- No dependency on Octane or any `@octanejs/*` package. See overview.md §1 for why.

### Issue #130 — DOX-A1

**GitHub Issue:** #130 — see tracker.md

#### DOX-A1 — Workspace skeleton + first pages

**GitHub Issue:** #130 — see tracker.md\_

**Title:**

```
DOX-A1 Create apps/dox (Astro + Starlight) and wire pnpm/oxlint
```

**Description:**

```
Part of the Dox epic — see `context/dox/index.md`, Tier 0, item DOX-A1.

## Gap
`apps/` does not exist in this monorepo and is not a workspace glob. `@northguild/gmt`
has 504 public functions and no documentation site — the only discovery path is
`packages/gmt/README.md`, whose "API Surface" section just links to GitHub tree URLs.

## Scope
- Create `apps/dox` as `@gmt/docs` (private, `"type": "module"`), depending on
  `@northguild/gmt` via `workspace:*`.
- Install `astro@7.2.7` and `@astrojs/starlight@0.41.9` (Starlight peers on
  `astro ^7.0.2` **and `@astrojs/markdown-remark ^7.2.0`** — verify both).
- `src/content.config.ts` defining the `docs` collection with Starlight's
  `docsLoader()` and `docsSchema()`.
- Ship real content, not placeholders: a landing page plus two hand-written pages
  (Install, Core Rules), both lifted from `packages/gmt/README.md`'s existing
  `## Install` and `## Core Rules` sections.
- Wire the four easy-to-miss integration files (see `context/dox/overview.md` §4):
  1. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — add `- 'apps/*'`
  2. root `package.json` — the `"workspaces"` array duplicates the glob; add `apps/*`
  3. `oxlint.config.js` — **note the `.js` extension**. Add `apps/**` to
     `files.include`; add `apps/dox/dist`, `apps/dox/.astro`, and the generated
     reference directory to `files.ignore`.
   4. `apps/dox/package.json` — declare `build`, `dev`, and `typecheck` scripts.
      The package is discovered by `pnpm -r` automatically via the `packages/*` workspace glob.
- Add root scripts `docs:dev` and `docs:build`.
- **Never hardcode a version number in the site.** Generate a version map from
  `packages/*/package.json` in a `prebuild`/`predev` step, so the docs cannot ship a
  stale version badge. `scripts/sync-intent-version.mjs` is the existing precedent for
  this shape of script — follow it rather than inventing a new pattern.
- Declare `engines: { "node": ">=22.12.0" }` on `apps/dox` — Astro 7's floor is higher
  than the repo root's `>=20 <25`.
- Add `apps/dox/dist`, `apps/dox/.astro`, and the generated reference directory to
  `.gitignore`.

## Before starting
**Check the local Node version.** `.nvmrc` declares `24`, but a local shell can easily
be on an older version that predates Astro 7's `>=22.12.0` floor — `nvm use` first, or
`DOX-A1` fails on the very first install.

Re-check that the four integration files have not drifted — read `pnpm-workspace.yaml`,
root `package.json`, and `oxlint.config.js` directly rather than trusting
this issue's snapshot. Note the config is `oxlint.config.js`, not `.ts`.

**Gate — resolve here, not later:** `apps/dox` must NOT extend `tsconfig.base.json`.
The base config sets `composite: true`, `emitDeclarationOnly: true`, `module: nodenext`,
and `customConditions: ["@northguild/source"]`, all of which are wrong for an Astro app.
Extend `astro/tsconfigs/strict` instead. If this fights the repo's setup in some way not
anticipated here, fix it in this story before anything is built on top.

Also check `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: it classifies changes as `gmt_changed` /
`non_gmt_changed` by grepping `^packages/gmt/`. Changes under `apps/` currently land in
`non_gmt_changed` and will run the non-GMT test job. Confirm that is the intent or add
an explicit branch — do not leave it accidental.

## Definition of done
- `pnpm install` resolves with `apps/dox` present.
- `pnpm run validate` is green across the monorepo.
- `pnpm docs:dev` serves a site with a working landing page and two readable content
  pages — real content from `packages/gmt/README.md`, not lorem ipsum.
- `pnpm docs:build` produces static output.
- `pnpm run validate` is green across the monorepo.
```

**Implementation notes.** Detail and evidence in `.agents/dox/tier0-infra.md`; that pack
is authoritative where it disagrees with this issue.

- The toolchain is **`fnm`**, and `fnm use` alone is a **silent no-op** in a
  non-interactive shell. Use `eval "$(fnm env)" && fnm use && …`.
- Starlight's `@astrojs/markdown-remark` peer is **optional**
  (`peerDependenciesMeta.optional: true`); Astro 7 ships `@astrojs/markdown-satteri`
  instead. **Do not declare it.** `@astrojs/mdx@7.0.8` imports `satteri` without
  declaring it, and two satteri versions in the tree stop pnpm hoisting it — fixed with
  a `packageExtensions` entry in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- pnpm 10 defaults `enable-pre-post-scripts` to false and there is no `.npmrc`, so
  `prebuild`/`predev` hooks never fire. The version map is chained with `&&` and wired
  to a root `package.json` script instead. It is **gitignored, not stubbed** — a stub would
  render a wrong version badge, the exact failure this story prevents, and `DOX-A1`
  ships no tests that need it to resolve on a clean checkout.
- `oxlint.config.js` is **never loaded** (`.js` is not in oxlint's discovery list), so
  the `apps/**` `files.include` edit is inert — it is there to document intent; the real
  mechanism is an explicit `docs:lint` target. An `apps/**` override also lives in
  `.oxfmtrc.json` (its `overrides` are an allow-list), plus a `docs_changed` output and
  an `apps`-aware artifact collector in `ci.yml`.

### Issue #131 — DOX-A2

**GitHub Issue:** #131 — see tracker.md

#### DOX-A2 — Deploy

**GitHub Issue:** #131 — see tracker.md\_

**Title:**

```
DOX-A2 Deploy apps/dox to Cloudflare Workers via GitHub Actions
```

**Description:**

```
Part of the Dox epic — see `context/dox/index.md`, Tier 0, item DOX-A2.
Depends on DOX-A1.

## Gap
No deployment pipeline exists. `.github/workflows/` has only `ci.yml` and `publish.yml`;
nothing deploys anything anywhere.

## Cloudflare, not GitHub Pages
**Pages is not enabled on this repo** (`gh api repos/northguild/gmt/pages` returns 404),
so there is nothing to migrate away from. A single Cloudflare Worker is the right target
regardless: with an `assets` binding it serves the static site today, and once Tier 6
exists it handles `/api/*` in the **same** deployment, same-origin, with no CORS
allowlist and no second pipeline. See `context/dox/overview.md` §2 "Hosting" for the full
reasoning. Deploying to Cloudflare now, even though nothing needs `/api/*` yet, avoids a
second migration later.

## Why this is story 2 and not story 13
This is deliberately done before any bulk content. Once it lands, every subsequent
story is verifiable on a live URL rather than a dev server. Deploying last would mean
nothing is ever seen in its real environment until the end. Two stories' worth of cost
buys the fastest feedback loop available.

## Scope
- `apps/dox/wrangler.jsonc` with an `assets` binding: `directory: "./dist"`,
  `binding: "ASSETS"`, `not_found_handling: "404-page"`. **No `main` is needed at this
  tier** — this is an assets-only Worker until Tier 6 adds `/api/*`.
- A GitHub Actions workflow deploying via `cloudflare/wrangler-action`, matching
  `ci.yml`'s existing conventions rather than introducing an unrelated pattern:
  `pnpm/action-setup@v4` pinned to `10.32.1`, `actions/setup-node@v4` with
  `cache: pnpm`, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm run validate` for the build.
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` as GitHub Actions repo secrets.
- Build order matters: `@northguild/gmt` must be built before `apps/dox`. The workspace `validate` script runs builds in dependency order.
- Confirm Pagefind search works in the deployed build — it is part of the Starlight
  production build and does not run in dev, so this is the first place it can be tested.

## Before starting
Confirm Cloudflare account access and that a project/token can be provisioned. This is a
hard dependency for shipping the MVP at all, not merely for the eventual chat — see
overview.md §7.

## Definition of done
- Push to `main` produces a live, reachable site.
- Every internal link resolves — click through all pages.
- Pagefind search returns results on the deployed site.
- The workflow does not run on pull requests from forks with write permissions.
```

**Implementation notes.** Detail and evidence in `.agents/dox/tier0-infra.md`; that pack
is authoritative where it disagrees with this issue.

- The shipped `wrangler.jsonc` has **no `binding`** — Cloudflare's docs say to omit the
  ASSETS binding when the Worker has no main script. It returns in Tier 6 with the
  `main` script that reads it.
- The project is named **`dox`**, not `docs`; every command in the deploy workflow
  uses `dox`.
- Adding `wrangler` as a devDependency required a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `allowBuilds`
  entry (`workerd: true`) — `workerd`'s `package.json` declares a `postinstall` pnpm
  blocks by default.
- Worker name `gmt-dox`, on the default `*.workers.dev` subdomain — no custom domain at
  this tier. Deploy triggers on every push to `main`; the workflow carries no
  `pull_request` trigger, which is what satisfies the "does not run on PRs from forks"
  line structurally. `astro.config.mjs`'s placeholder `SITE` constant is left as-is
  pending provisioning.

**Open:** `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` are not yet provisioned, so
the three DoD lines requiring a live deployed site are unverified until the user
completes Cloudflare provisioning and a push to `main` triggers the first real deploy.

### Issue #132 — DOX-A3

**GitHub Issue:** #132 — see tracker.md

`DOX-A3` spans two sub-stories: `DOX-A3a` (Tier 0) and `DOX-A3b` (Tier 1). The issue stays
open until `DOX-A3b` also lands.

#### DOX-A3a — Reference generator

**GitHub Issue:** #132 — see tracker.md\_ (folds into #132 alongside `DOX-A3b`; the issue
stays open until `DOX-A3b` also lands)

**Title:**

```
DOX-A3a Generate one MDX reference page per gmt function from JSDoc
```

**Description:**

```
Part of the Dox epic — see `context/dox/index.md`, Tier 0, item DOX-A3a.
Depends on DOX-A2 (so output is immediately visible on the live site).

## Gap
504 public functions with 1,860 `@example` lines and 96.5% JSDoc coverage, and no way
to read any of it except by opening source files on GitHub. This story is the single
highest-value piece of work in the epic — it converts existing, already-written,
already-accurate documentation into a browsable site.

## Scope
- `apps/dox/scripts/build-reference.ts` walks `packages/gmt/src/**/*.ts` using the
  **TypeScript compiler API** — not regex — and extracts per function: namespace,
  module, name, full signature, description, behavior bullets, `@param`, `@returns`,
  and every `@example` as a `{ call, result, note }` triple.
- Emit one MDX page per exported function into
  `src/content/docs/reference/<namespace>/<module>/<fnName>.mdx`, plus a module index
  page per directory.
- Sidebar via Starlight's `autogenerate: { directory: 'reference' }` — the `src/` tree
  is already a correct taxonomy (namespace → module → function), so nav is free.
- The same run emits two further artifacts, making three consumers of one extraction:
   - `gmt-corpus.json` — the same content as retrieval chunks, each carrying the URL of
     the page it came from. `DOX-A3b`'s `llms-full.txt` is built from this, and Tier 6's
     retrieval reads from it if that tier is reached.
   - A **route manifest** — the set of every URL this run generated. Consumed here by a
     build-time link check, by `DOX-A3b`'s AI surface, and defensively by `DOX-C3a` if
     Tier 6 is reached, so a hallucinated citation degrades to plain text instead of a
     404. This is cheap here because the generator already knows every route it
     produced; see `context/dox/overview.md` §2 "Citation integrity". Emit it as a typed
     module (a `ReadonlySet<string>`), not raw JSON, so the client gets type safety for
     free.
 - `LIVE_PLAYGROUND_TEMPLATES` — a raw call-string template per function (e.g.
   `addDate("2024-03-15", { days: 5 })`) that seeds the `<PlaygroundLive>` textarea.
   Synthesized from the first `@example` if present, otherwise from the function's
   `playgroundSpec` param values.
- Building the site, the corpus, the manifest, and the playground templates from one
  extraction is what guarantees they cannot drift.
- Generated MDX is gitignored and produced by a prebuild step wired into the `build`
  target.
- **Ship a stub for the generated modules.** The corpus and route manifest are
  gitignored, so anything importing them fails on a clean checkout — including tests in
  CI before the build runs. Commit a stub (empty corpus, empty route set) and alias it in
  the Vitest config, so tests run with no build step. Borrowed from the sibling repo's
  setup; see overview.md §2 "Reviewed prior art".
- A Vitest test asserts the function and example counts, so adding a `gmt` function
  without re-extracting fails CI. Derive the counts from source; do not hardcode a
  snapshot — the count still drifts with ordinary npm releases even though
  `context/roadmap/` itself is now complete through v1.14.0.
- Link each page to its GitHub source path. `packages/gmt/tsconfig.build.json` sets
  `declarationMap: false`, so there are no declaration maps to drive this; the
  generator knows the source path anyway.

## The real risk in this story — read this before writing the parser
The `@example` line format is **not** the biggest generator risk. Measured across all
1,860 examples: 1,859 match one shape exactly — `@example fnName(args) // result
(optional parenthetical)`, split on `/\s+\/\/\s/` because `context/jsdoc-standards.md`
shows padding-aligned results — and zero contain a second ` // `. Exactly one example is
multi-line: `getDstTransitions` (`packages/gmt/src/zoned/get/getDstTransitions.ts:34-39`),
whose array result continues on following ` * // ` lines. **This parser is roughly
fifteen lines and one named edge case, not the epic's hardest problem.**

TypeDoc is still the wrong tool — it would treat `@example` as a fenced block regardless
— but the reason to avoid it that actually matters is that `src/` has **zero**
`@category`, `@see`, `@throws`, and `@since` tags (and only 9 `@link` occurrences), so
there is **no cross-link graph to extract from tags at all**. Taxonomy and cross-linking
must come from the directory tree (already correct) and from type references in each
signature.

**The actual hard work is signatures, options objects, and the 42 public types:**
`startOfZoned`'s `@param options` is a single ~400-character prose line covering four
option keys with embedded bold and backticks — turning that into a linked parameter
table is the high-value, high-risk part of this story. The 42 public types (18 in
`src/types/`, 24 co-located, e.g. `DstTransition` and the 15 `Format*Options`
interfaces) each need a page, or every signature renders as a wall of dead identifiers.

Handle two named edge cases deliberately, not as afterthoughts:
- `getDstTransitions`'s multi-line example, above.
- `packages/gmt/src/plain/calculate/weekOfYear.ts` — the **only** file in the library
  exporting two functions, so "one page per file" holds 503/504 times, not 504/504.

## Before starting
1. Read `context/jsdoc-standards.md` for the exact required JSDoc shape.
2. Read `packages/gmt/src/zoned/calculate/startOfZoned.ts` in full **before writing the
   parser**. It has the heaviest JSDoc in the codebase — an options object, multi-clause
   bullets with embedded bold and backticks, and five annotated examples with
   parenthetical explanations after the `// result`. Build the parser against that file
   first. If it handles `startOfZoned`, it handles the `@example` line format
   everywhere; the options table is the part that still needs real design work.
3. Re-verify the counts. `context/roadmap/` is complete through v1.14.0, but ordinary
   npm releases continue, so re-derive from source rather than trusting any number here.
4. Note the 18 files with no JSDoc block: the 13 `src/regex/*.ts` files (which use `//`
   line comments above each exported `RegExp` instead — they need their own handling,
   not a skip), plus `utc/calculate/startOrEndOfUtc.ts`, `utc/format/formatUtc.ts`,
   `unix/calculate/startOrEndOfUnix.ts`, `unix/interval/resolveUnixIntervalPair.ts`, and
   `unix/format/formatUnix.ts`, which are genuinely undocumented. Decide whether to emit
   a stub page or fix the source; do not let them silently vanish from the site.

## Decision required in this story
The six `packages/gmt/src/*/README.md` files are flat function-name indexes with no
signatures and no examples. This generated site fully supersedes them.

`packages/gmt/package.json` sets `"files": ["dist", "LICENSE", "skills"]`, and the build
is plain `tsc`, which does not copy `.md` into `dist`. **These READMEs do not ship in the
npm tarball** — they exist only on GitHub. That makes replacing them with short stubs pointing at the site the
low-cost option, since no published consumer reads them.

**Decide deliberately and record the decision here.** Either way, note that
`.agents/skills/update-readme` maintains these files and would need updating to match,
and that changing them touches `packages/gmt` and so needs a changeset. Do not leave
them to silently rot.

## Definition of done
- Every currently-exported function has a generated page, reachable from the sidebar.
- **The spot-check:** the generated `startOfZoned` page matches
  `packages/gmt/src/zoned/calculate/startOfZoned.ts` line by line — all five examples
  with their parentheticals intact, the options bullet rendered as a real parameter
  table with types linked, the signature correct. If that page is right, the generator
  is right.
- `getDstTransitions`'s multi-line example renders correctly, and both of
  `weekOfYear.ts`'s exports get their own page.
- `gmt-corpus.json` is emitted, and every entry's page URL resolves to a real page.
- The route manifest is emitted and its contents exactly equal the set of pages actually
  generated — assert this in the same test, since a manifest that drifts from reality is
  worse than none (it would silently suppress valid links or admit dead ones).
- The generated-module stub is committed and `pnpm run docs:test` passes on a clean
  checkout with no prior build.
- The corpus-count Vitest test is in place and fails when a function is added without
  re-extraction (verify by temporarily adding one).
- Searching `addBusinessDays` on the deployed site lands on its page.
- The namespace-README decision is recorded.
```

#### DOX-A3b — AI surface (`llms.txt`)

**GitHub Issue:** #132 — see tracker.md\_ (folds into the same issue as `DOX-A3a`; the
issue stays open until this sub-story also lands)

**Title:**

```
DOX-A3b Emit llms.txt, llms-full.txt, and per-page raw markdown from the corpus
```

**Description:**

```
Part of the Dox epic — see `context/dox/index.md`, Tier 1, item DOX-A3b.
Depends on DOX-A3a (the corpus and route manifest) and DOX-A5 (so the "copy as markdown"
affordance has somewhere to live in the token layer).

## Gap
The site has no machine-readable surface. `llms.txt`/`llms-full.txt` cost roughly a day
given DOX-A3a's corpus already exists, and they make every model the reader already has
open — not only a purpose-built chatbot — answer correctly about GMT. This
library already ships `skills/` for agents; a meaningful fraction of its audience is
machine, and this is the cheapest possible extension of that audience to the docs site.

## Scope
- `llms.txt` — a nav index in the llms.txt convention, generated from the route
  manifest and page titles/descriptions DOX-A3a already extracted.
- `llms-full.txt` — the full corpus as plain text, generated from `gmt-corpus.json`.
- A raw `.md` route alongside every rendered reference and guide page (e.g.
  `/reference/zoned/calculate/startOfZoned.md`), and a "copy as markdown" affordance on
  each page using DOX-A5's tokens.
- Evaluate `starlight-llms-txt@0.11.0` against emitting directly from DOX-A3a's
  already-parsed corpus. The plugin derives its output from rendered MDX, which would
  duplicate parsing work the generator already did and risks a second source of drift;
  emitting directly from the corpus is probably the better call here, but confirm rather
  than assume.
- Every URL this story emits must exist in DOX-A3a's route manifest — reuse it rather
  than reconstructing the page list.

## Before starting
Confirm DOX-A3a's corpus carries everything needed (title, description, full body text)
for a plain-text nav index and full corpus dump without re-walking `packages/gmt/src`.

## Definition of done
- `llms.txt` is reachable at the site root and lists every generated page.
- `llms-full.txt` contains the full corpus as plain text.
- Every page has a working raw `.md` route and a working "copy as markdown" control.
- No URL in either file is absent from DOX-A3a's route manifest.
```

### Issue #134 — DOX-A5

**GitHub Issue:** #134 — see tracker.md

#### DOX-A5 — Brand pass

**GitHub Issue:** #134 — see tracker.md\_

**Title:**

```
DOX-A5 Apply gmt palette, typography, and token layer to Starlight
```

**Description:**

```
Part of the Dox epic — see `context/dox/index.md`, Tier 1, item DOX-A5.
Depends on DOX-A3a (real content to style).

## Ordering
This runs **before** DOX-A4a and `DOX-A3b`, and before any of Tier 2's widgets. Every
widget built in Tier 2 onward is styled from these tokens — building them against
unstyled Starlight first would mean restyling every one of them twice.

## Gap
The site works but looks like stock Starlight. This story is the cheap 80% of visual
identity — palette, typography, tokens — deliberately separated from the expensive 20%
(glass, animated borders, chamfer) which is Tier 3.

## Scope
- A token layer as CSS custom properties: color, spacing, tracking, timing. **No
  literals in component styles.**
- Wire it through Starlight's `customCss` config option, mapping onto Starlight's own
  documented CSS custom properties rather than fighting its cascade.
- The palette from `context/dox/overview.md` §3 "Color": Void `#03080C`, Cyan `#22D3EE`,
  Spring `#4ADE80`, Teal `#0E7490`, Ice `#CFEAF2`, Signal-lost `#F5A524`.
- **Body copy is Ice, not cyan or green.** Saturated blue-green at paragraph length is
  fatiguing and rarely clears contrast. The blue/green identity is carried by borders,
  headings, labels, and live values — not by prose.
- Typography per overview.md §3: JetBrains Mono for body and code, a display face
  (Chakra Petch / Michroma / Orbitron) for headings and labels only. **Long-form content
  is never set in the display face.** Self-host the subsets — no runtime CDN request.
- Reserve Signal-lost amber exclusively for the sentinel treatment (`DOX-B1a` will use
  it, and so will every Tier 2 widget per overview.md §3 "Widget chrome"). Its rarity is
  what makes it communicate; spending it on general warnings destroys that.

## Explicitly out of scope
No glass panels, no `backdrop-filter`, no animated borders, no chamfered corners, no
boot sequence. Those are `DOX-D1`/`DOX-D2` in Tier 3, applied later over pages and
widgets that already work. Read overview.md §3's opening — "maximal chrome, disciplined
content surface" — and note this story is entirely the *content surface* half.

## Before starting
Read `context/dox/overview.md` §3, specifically the "Color", "Typography", and "Widget
chrome" subsections. "Widget chrome" covers the sentinel/live-value rules that Tier 2's
widgets depend on this story delivering correctly.

## Definition of done
- Body text clears **7:1 contrast**, measured against real rendered pages, not flat
  swatches.
- Self-hosted fonts — confirm via devtools Network that no request goes to
  `fonts.googleapis.com` or `fonts.gstatic.com` at runtime.
- **Keyboard-only pass with the mouse unplugged.** Starlight's baseline is good; capture
  that it still is, because this is the "before" measurement that `DOX-D1` will be
  checked against.
- No color literal appears in any component style — every one goes through a token.
- Light/dark handling is coherent (Starlight ships both; decide deliberately whether
  this design supports a light mode or commits to dark, and make that explicit).
```

### Issue #133 — DOX-A4

**GitHub Issue:** #133 — see tracker.md

`DOX-A4` spans four sub-stories: `DOX-A4a` (Tier 1) and `DOX-A4b`–`d` (Tier 5). The issue
stays open until `DOX-A4d` also lands.

#### DOX-A4a — Guides

**GitHub Issue:** #133 — see tracker.md\_ (folds into #133 alongside `DOX-A4b`–`DOX-A4d`)

**Title:**

```
DOX-A4a Port README Quick Start, DST doc, and skills Core Patterns into the docs site
```

**Description:**

```
Part of the Dox epic — see `context/dox/index.md`, Tier 1, item DOX-A4a.
Depends on DOX-A3a (so guides can link into the reference) and DOX-A5 (tokens to style
against).

## Scope boundary with DOX-A4c
This story ports the Core Patterns / Quick Start content; `DOX-A4c` in Tier 5 ports the
63 severity-graded "Common Mistakes" with live proof. Both land on issue #133.

## Gap
DOX-A3a gives the site accuracy — signatures and examples. It does not give it judgment.
Knowing *when* a user needs `Pacific/Chatham` handling is not in a function signature.

The material for this already exists and is good; it is just not reachable.

## Scope
Hand-curated MDX under `src/content/docs/guides/`, ported rather than written:

- **`packages/gmt/README.md`'s Quick Start** — most of its 1,633 lines are runnable,
  annotated TypeScript across six sections (Plain arithmetic and comparisons, Durations,
  Intervals, Zoned operations, Formatting, Unix and UTC helpers). Split into topical
  guides; the Intervals section alone should become several pages.
- **`docs/dst-disambiguation.md`** — move in wholesale. It is a genuinely excellent
  139-line conceptual guide that is currently orphaned: linked only from JSDoc, with no
  index and no nav. This story is where it finally gets a home.
- **The 11 domain `packages/gmt/skills/*/SKILL.md` guides' Core Patterns sections** —
  reshaped into task-oriented pages. Do not port their "Common Mistakes" sections here
  — that content, already severity-graded CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM with wrong-vs-right
  code pairs, is `DOX-A4c`'s job in Tier 5, where it gets live proof via `DOX-B1a`'s
  playground rather than static code blocks.
- Link guides into DOX-A3a's reference pages and vice versa where natural.

## Before starting
Read `packages/gmt/skills/_artifacts/domain_map.yaml` and `skill_tree.yaml`. They are a
ready-made information architecture for exactly this content — use them for guide
ordering and grouping rather than inventing a structure.

Then read all 11 domain SKILL.md files before drafting. Several contain gotchas written
for precisely this purpose (the `zoned-date-ops` skill's disambiguation/offset traps,
`durations`' `relativeTo` requirement). Reuse, don't rewrite.

Note the two frontmatter shapes in `skills/`: domain skills carry a `sources:` list
mapping to source files (useful for cross-linking to DOX-A3a's pages), while the seven
maintainer/workflow skills (`pr-contribution`, `issue-creation`, etc.) do not and are
**not** user-facing docs — exclude them.

## Definition of done
- Guides are reachable from the sidebar and cross-link into reference pages.
- `docs/dst-disambiguation.md` is in the nav. Decide whether the top-level file remains
  as the source of truth or the site copy becomes canonical — do not leave two
  diverging copies.
- A reader can answer "how do I schedule a meeting across a DST boundary" from the
  guides alone, without opening a source file.
- No content was re-derived that already existed in README, skills, or `docs/`.

#### DOX-A4b — Scenario template + first three scenarios

**GitHub Issue:** #133 — see tracker.md\_ (folds into the same issue as `DOX-A4a`)

**Title:**

```
DOX-A4b Build the real-world scenario page template and ship three scenarios
```

**Description:**

```
Part of the Dox epic — see `context/dox/index.md`, Tier 5, item DOX-A4b. The
mentor/teacher layer.
Depends on DOX-B1a (the playground the "live widget" step in each scenario runs).

## Gap
DOX-A4a's guides are organized by API area (Plain arithmetic, Durations, …). A reader
who has a real task — "I need to schedule a recurring meeting across a DST boundary" —
has to assemble the answer from several guides themselves. No page in the plan currently
teaches by demonstrating failure, which is the most persuasive way to teach a
correctness library.

## Scope
- A fixed page template with five parts, in order: **the naive approach** (plausible
  code using `Date` or an obvious-but-wrong `gmt` call) → **a live widget showing it
  break** (DOX-B1a's playground, seeded with an input that exposes the bug) → **why**
  (a short, specific explanation, not a restatement of the bug) → **the gmt approach**
  (the correct code) → **the same widget working** (a second playground instance,
  correct output).
- Ship the template plus three scenarios chosen from: recurring meetings across a DST
  boundary; storing a birthday (plain date vs. instant); "posted 3 hours ago"; booking
  availability windows; a flight crossing the date line; monthly billing without drift;
  the `Pacific/Chatham` +12:45 case the CI matrix already exercises.

## Before starting
Read `packages/gmt/skills/_artifacts/domain_map.yaml` for task-shaped framing already
written for a related purpose, and the 11 domain `SKILL.md` files' Common Mistakes
sections (see `DOX-A4c`) for scenarios that overlap — do not develop the same example
twice in two different tiers.

## Definition of done
- The template renders correctly for all three shipped scenarios.
- Each scenario's "broken" widget genuinely reproduces the failure it claims to, and the
  "fixed" widget genuinely does not.
- A reader can complete a scenario start to finish without opening a source file or the
  browser console.

#### DOX-A4c — Ported pitfalls

**GitHub Issue:** #133 — see tracker.md\_ (folds into the same issue as `DOX-A4a`)

**Title:**

```
DOX-A4c Port severity-graded SKILL.md mistakes into pitfall pages with live proof
```

**Description:**

```
Part of the Dox epic — see `context/dox/index.md`, Tier 5, item DOX-A4c.
Depends on DOX-A4a (guides to cross-link into) and DOX-B1a (the playground providing live
proof).

## Gap
11 domain `SKILL.md` files already contain **63 severity-graded mistakes** (1 CRITICAL,
23 HIGH, 39 MEDIUM), each written as a wrong-vs-right code pair. None of it is on the
docs site. This is explicitly **not a writing project** — the content exists in almost
exactly the shape a pitfall page needs; the work is porting it and adding live proof.

## Scope
- One pitfall page (or a grouped page per domain, decide deliberately) per graded
  mistake, rendering the existing wrong-vs-right pair with DOX-B1a's playground proving
  the "wrong" code produces the documented bad output and the "right" code does not.
- Preserve the severity grading visually — CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM should be
  immediately scannable, not buried in prose.
- Cross-link every pitfall page from the reference pages (DOX-A3a) whose functions it
  concerns, and from the relevant guide (DOX-A4a).

## Before starting
Read all 11 domain `SKILL.md` files' Common Mistakes sections in full before starting —
do not sample a few and extrapolate a template that does not fit the rest. Note the
severity counts (1 CRITICAL, 23 HIGH, 39 MEDIUM) to confirm none are dropped silently.

## Definition of done
- All 63 mistakes are represented on the site with live proof, not static code alone.
- Severity is visually scannable across the full set.
- Every pitfall page is cross-linked from at least one reference page and one guide.
- No mistake's content was rewritten from scratch where the source already stated it
  clearly — this is a port, not a rewrite.

#### DOX-A4d — Scenario index

**GitHub Issue:** #133 — see tracker.md\_ (folds into the same issue as `DOX-A4a`)

**Title:**

```
DOX-A4d Build a mentor-voiced scenario index driven by domain_map.yaml
```

**Description:**

```
Part of the Dox epic — see `context/dox/index.md`, Tier 5, item DOX-A4d.
Depends on DOX-A4b and DOX-A4c (content to index).

## Gap
504 functions create a discovery problem that neither Pagefind search nor a sidebar
alone solves — a reader who does not yet know a function's name cannot search for it.
`packages/gmt/skills/_artifacts/domain_map.yaml` is a ready-made task→function map built
for exactly this problem and is currently unused by the site.

## Scope
- A "start here" index page, driven by `domain_map.yaml`, organized by task ("I have X
  and need Y") rather than by namespace or function name.
- Surface DOX-A4b's scenarios and DOX-A4c's pitfalls from this index alongside reference
  and guide links, so it functions as a single mentor-voiced entry point rather than one
  more content type competing with the others.

## Before starting
Read `domain_map.yaml` and `skill_tree.yaml` together — the domain map gives task
groupings, the skill tree gives the finer-grained skill list within each domain.

## Definition of done
- A reader with a task in mind but no function name in mind can reach the right
  reference page, guide, or scenario within two clicks from this index.
- Every domain in `domain_map.yaml` is represented.
```
