# Coding Standards

## API Contract

- All public functions accept **ISO 8601 strings** (or numeric Unix epochs where the domain requires it).
- Return types: ISO strings, numbers, booleans, or arrays — never `Date` objects or Temporal objects.
- Invalid input returns a typed sentinel — never throws:

| Return type | Sentinel |
| ----------- | -------- |
| `string`    | `""`     |
| `number`    | `null`   |
| `boolean`   | `false`  |
| `array`     | `[]`     |

- **`get/` namespaces hold current-moment accessors only** — no argument, or timezone only, reporting a value for _now_ (e.g. `getDay()`, `getZonedDay(timeZone)`). Any function taking a date value belongs in `calculate/` (or `parse/`, `compare/`, `format/` as its verb dictates) — see J0b, which relocated `getLocaleDayOfWeek`/`getLocaleZonedDayOfWeek` out of `get/` for violating this.

## Allowed vs. Forbidden Patterns

### Allowed

| Pattern                          | Example                                 |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ISO strings                      | `"2024-03-10"`                          |
| Temporal objects (internal only) | `Temporal.PlainDate.from("2024-03-10")` |
| Tree-shakable exports            | `export * from "./plain"`               |

### Forbidden

| Pattern               | Replacement                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `new Date()`          | `Temporal.Now.instant()`                   |
| `date.getTime()`      | `Temporal.Instant.from(date).epochSeconds` |
| Manual string parsing | `Temporal.PlainDate.from(string)`          |
| Mutating methods      | Use Temporal's immutable methods           |

## Always Wrap Temporal Calls in Try-Catch

Temporal's static methods (`.from()`, `.add()`, `.subtract()`, `.since()`, `.until()`, etc.) throw `RangeError` on invalid input. Every call must be wrapped:

```ts
export function addDays(dateStr: string, days: number): string {
  try {
    const date = Temporal.PlainDate.from(dateStr);
    return date.add({ days }).toString();
  } catch {
    return "";
  }
}
```

- Wrap the entire block that uses Temporal methods.
- The catch block takes no argument (`catch { ... }`) — we never need the error value.
- Return the appropriate sentinel for the function's return type.

### Scoped exception: manual string parsing in `parse*WithPattern` (J11 / Decision 4)

"Manual string parsing" is forbidden everywhere in GMT **except** the `parseDateWithPattern` / `parseDateTimeWithPattern` / `parseTimeWithPattern` family (`packages/gmt/src/plain/parse/`, engine in `packages/gmt/src/internal/patternToken.ts`), because Temporal has no `fromFormat`-style equivalent and this is the only way to decode a caller-supplied token pattern. The exception is bound by three rules, not a blanket carve-out:

1. The regex is built **from the pattern string itself** at call time — never hand-rolled per-format string slicing.
2. Extracted fields are **always** handed to `Temporal.*.from(fields, { overflow: "reject" })` for final construction and validation — a regex match only proves shape, never validity (e.g. `"02/31/2024"` matches `"MM/dd/yyyy"` but is not a real date).
3. The try-catch and sentinel-return rules above are unchanged.

See `context/roadmap/issues/J.md` Decision 4 for the full rationale — archived on parity in `9e3b22d`, so read it with `git show 9e3b22d^:context/roadmap/issues/J.md`. This prohibition stands for every other function in the library.

### Scoped exception: fixed non-ISO grammars in `parseRfc2822`/`parseHttp` (J13)

The same three rules extend to `parseRfc2822` (`packages/gmt/src/zoned/parse/`) and `parseHttp` (`packages/gmt/src/utc/parse/`), for the same underlying reason as Decision 4: RFC 5322 and RFC 7231 date-times (`"Fri, 15 Mar 2024 14:30:00 -0400"`, `"Fri, 15 Mar 2024 14:30:00 GMT"`) are not ISO 8601 and Temporal's `.from()` cannot parse them at all — there is no `fromRFC2822`/`fromHTTPDate` equivalent to defer to, at any layer. Unlike `parse*WithPattern`, the grammar here is fixed (a hardcoded regex per format, not built from a caller-supplied pattern), which makes this an even narrower case than Decision 4's, not a broader one:

1. The regex encodes the fixed RFC grammar exactly (`regex/rfc-2822.ts`, `regex/http-date.ts`) — never hand-rolled per-call string slicing.
2. Extracted fields are **always** handed to `Temporal.PlainDateTime.from(fields, { overflow: "reject" })` for final construction and validation.
3. The try-catch and sentinel-return rules above are unchanged.

`parseSql` and `parseRfc3339` are **not** part of this exception — both validate shape with a regex and then hand the whole string to `Temporal.*.from(string)` directly (which strictly validates the calendar date on its own), never extracting or constructing a field property bag by hand. This prohibition stands for every other function in the library.

### Scoped exception: GMT's calendar-annotated date string in `convertDateToCalendar` (E1)

The same three rules extend to `internal/calendarDateString.ts`'s `parseCalendarDateValue`, used by `convertDateToCalendar` (`packages/gmt/src/plain/convert/`). GMT's calendar-annotated PlainDate string (`"5785-01-01[u-ca=hebrew]"`) is a fixed, GMT-invented grammar — deliberately diverging from Temporal's own `[u-ca=...]` string convention (which keeps ISO/proleptic-Gregorian digits and only tags the calendar) so the calendar's native year/month/day are visible in the string itself, per the story's design rationale:

1. The regex (`regex/calendar-date.ts`) encodes the fixed grammar exactly — never hand-rolled per-call string slicing.
2. Extracted fields are **always** handed to `Temporal.PlainDate.from(fields, { overflow: "reject" })` for final construction and validation — including rejecting unknown calendar identifiers, which Temporal validates on GMT's behalf.
3. The try-catch and sentinel-return rules above are unchanged.

**Which namespaces accept this grammar (E5 issue #78, extended by E7 issue #152):**

- **`plain/` `PlainDate`** — `addDate`/`subtractDate`/`diffDate`/`diffDateAsDuration` and the `Date`-suffixed `plain/interval/*` functions, plus `duration/`'s `relativeTo` option (via `internal/resolveDurationRelativeTo.ts`). `plain/` `PlainDateTime`/`PlainTime` functions have no calendar-annotated grammar of their own and simply treat a `PlainDate` annotation as invalid input.
- **`zoned/`, the ~18 calendar-aware functions** — E7 added a _separate_ GMT-native zoned grammar, `<date>T<time><offset>[u-ca=<id>[;era=<era>]][<timeZone>]` (`regex/calendar-zoned-date-time.ts`, parsed/formatted by `internal/calendarZonedString.ts`). The same three rules above apply to it: the regex encodes the fixed grammar, the extracted date half is handed to `Temporal.PlainDate.from(fields, { overflow: "reject" })` via the _existing_ `parseCalendarDateValue`, and the recomposed ISO string is handed to `Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from` for zone/offset/DST validation. In scope: `addZoned`, `subtractZoned`, `diffZoned`, `diffZonedAsDuration`, `convertZonedToCalendar`, and `zoned/interval/*`. These gate on the parallel `isValidCalendarZonedDateTime`/`isValidCalendarZonedInterval`.
- **`zoned/`, everything else (~72 functions), plus `utc/` and `unix/`** — reject the annotation outright (`internal/hasCalendarAnnotation.ts`, and `isValidZonedDateTime`/`isValidZonedInterval`, which E7 deliberately did NOT loosen). `zoned/` rejected it wholesale only between E5 and E7; before E5, `isValidZonedDateTime` had no gate and silently accepted Temporal's _own_ shape (see `context/roadmap/issues/E.md`'s E5 outcome, decision D2, and E7's reversal of that verdict for the in-scope subset).

**Segment ordering in the zoned grammar is `[u-ca=...]` before `[timeZone]` — the reverse of RFC 9557 — and is not re-openable.** GMT's digits are calendar-native, so the string is never valid RFC 9557 regardless; the `;era=` suffix is not valid RFC 9557 at any ordering; and the RFC-legal ordering is the dangerous one, because `Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from("5784-01-01T14:30:00-05:00[America/New_York][u-ca=hebrew]")` succeeds and silently reads a Hebrew year as an ISO year. See `regex/calendar-zoned-date-time.ts`.

Do not extend the grammar to a new namespace (e.g. `PlainDateTime`, `utc/`) without a new roadmap story — see E5's decision D1 and E7's explicit "not in scope" list.

This prohibition stands for every other function in the library.

## Loop Style

Avoid `while` loops in new code. Prefer `for` loops or array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.). `while` loops are more error-prone and harder to reason about than bounded `for` loops.

## Plain / Zoned Separation

- `plain/` — timezone-free operations (`PlainDate`, `PlainTime`, `PlainDateTime`)
- `zoned/` — IANA timezone-aware operations (`ZonedDateTime`)
- Never mix the two in the same function or module.

## Linting Enforcement

The `Date` API ban is enforced at the AST level by three optional linting packages:

- `@northguild/gmt-eslint` — ESLint flat config
- `@northguild/gmt-biome` — Biome + GritQL plugins
- `@northguild/gmt-oxlint` — Oxlint JS plugin

If the linter passes, no `Date` object crept in.
