# GMTIME-B — Duration conversion

**Audited 2026-09-01.** All functions map to existing gmt APIs. No invented types, no OTel dependency. See [overview.md](../overview.md) for the full corrected spec.

Each story below is one logical unit; its sub-stories are nested under it and ordered as
they should be built. The issue stays open until its last sub-story lands.

## Definition of done — binding for every story in this file

  - `pnpm run validate` stays green, **including the 20-cell
  GMT timezone matrix**. `packages/gmt-time` must not perturb `packages/gmt`.
- **Changesets required.** `@northguild/gmt-time` is published to npm, so every story
  that modifies source needs a `.changeset/*.md` entry.
- No `Date` object anywhere. All inputs are ISO 8601 strings; outputs are strings, numbers,
  booleans, or arrays.
- Wrap all Temporal calls in `try-catch`. Bad input returns sentinels, never throws.

### GMTIME-B1 — Duration conversion (`toDurationNanoseconds` + `fromDurationNanoseconds`)

**Title:**

```
GMTIME-B1 Implement toDurationNanoseconds and fromDurationNanoseconds
```

**Description:**

```
Part of the gmt-time + gmt-otel epic — see `context/otel/overview.md`, Phase 2.
Depends on GMTIME-A1 (package skeleton).

## Gap
Systems store durations as nanosecond counts (number). gmt works with ISO 8601 duration
strings (e.g., `"PT1H30M"`). We need to bridge that gap — no OTel dependency.

## Scope
- `src/durations.ts`:
  - `toDurationNanoseconds(durationString: string): number` — converts a gmt-style ISO
    8601 duration string (e.g., `"PT1H30M"`, `"P1DT2H"`) to nanoseconds as a number.
    Uses `@northguild/gmt/duration/calculate` internally: parse the duration string,
    then extract nanoseconds via Temporal.Duration's internal arithmetic.
  - `fromDurationNanoseconds(nanoseconds: number): string` — converts nanoseconds back to
    an ISO 8601 duration string.
- Both functions throw `RangeError` on invalid input.

## What gmt provides (do not re-implement)
- `duration/parse` — parses ISO 8601 duration strings into Temporal.Duration objects.
- `duration/format` — serializes Temporal.Duration back to ISO 8601 strings.
- `duration/calculate` — extracts numeric values from durations in various units.

## Verification
- Round-trip: `fromDurationNanoseconds(toDurationNanoseconds(dur)) === dur` for valid inputs
- Invalid input throws `RangeError`
- Edge cases: zero duration, sub-millisecond precision, multi-day durations
```

### GMTIME-B2 — Duration conversion tests

**Title:**

```
GMTIME-B2 Add comprehensive tests for duration conversion
```

**Description:**

```
Part of the gmt-time + gmt-otel epic — see `context/otel/overview.md`, Phase 2.
Depends on GMTIME-B1 (duration implementation).

## Gap
No tests exist yet for any gmt-time function.

## Scope
- `test/durations.test.ts`:
  - Round-trip tests: `fromDurationNanoseconds(toDurationNanoseconds(dur)) === dur` for valid inputs
  - Invalid input throws `RangeError` (not sentinels — gmt-time is a thin bridge)
  - Edge cases: zero duration, sub-millisecond precision, multi-day durations
  - ISO 8601 format variants: `"PT1H"`, `"P1DT2H"`, `"PT30M"`, etc.

## Verification
- All tests pass
  - `pnpm --filter @northguild/gmt-time run test` covers all exported duration functions
```
