# DST Disambiguation

Twice a year, in timezones that observe Daylight Saving Time, the mapping between "local wall-clock time" and "actual instant" breaks down. This doc explains why, and how GMT lets you control what happens.

## The problem

A plain datetime like `"2024-03-10T02:30:00"` has no timezone attached — it's just numbers on a clock face. To turn it into a real instant, you attach a timezone (e.g. `"America/New_York"`). Normally that's a 1:1 mapping. But on the two days a year DST changes, it isn't:

- **Spring-forward gap**: clocks jump forward, so a whole hour of wall-clock time never happens. On 2024-03-10, `America/New_York` went straight from `01:59:59` to `03:00:00`. The time `02:30:00` **does not exist** that day.
- **Fall-back overlap**: clocks jump backward, so an hour of wall-clock time happens **twice**. On 2024-11-03, `America/New_York` went from `01:59:59` back to `01:00:00` and counted up again. The time `01:30:00` happens **twice** — once before the clocks fall back, once after.

If you don't think about this, code that attaches a timezone to a plain datetime will silently pick _something_ for these cases — and libraries differ (and have had bugs) around what that "something" is. GMT makes the choice explicit instead of hiding it.

## The four resolution strategies

Both scenarios need a tiebreak rule. Temporal (and GMT, which wraps it) offers four:

| Value                    | Gap behavior           | Overlap behavior    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| `"compatible"` (default) | same as `"later"`      | same as `"earlier"` |
| `"earlier"`              | pre-transition offset  | first occurrence    |
| `"later"`                | post-transition offset | second occurrence   |
| `"reject"`               | GMT returns `""`       | GMT returns `""`    |

- **Gap** (`"earlier"`/`"later"`): a nonexistent wall-clock time doesn't have a "before"/"after" instant of its own, so these resolve by pretending the transition happened either before or after the given time — `"earlier"` = pre-transition offset, `"later"` = post-transition offset.
- **Overlap** (`"earlier"`/`"later"`): the wall-clock time genuinely happens twice — these just pick the first or second real occurrence.

`"compatible"` is the default because it matches what most runtimes and other datetime libraries do out of the box — it's the safe, unsurprising choice if you don't have an opinion. Reach for `"earlier"`/`"later"` when your domain has a specific rule (e.g. "always round DST-gap appointments forward"), and `"reject"` when an ambiguous/nonexistent time should be a hard validation error rather than silently resolved.

## Four DST-related questions, four different functions

Beyond `disambiguation`/`offset` (this doc's main subject — what to do when _constructing_ a value lands on an ambiguous or nonexistent instant), GMT has three more DST-related functions with easily-confused names. Route by the question you're actually asking:

| Your question                                                                   | Function                               | Scope                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Does this zone observe DST at all?                                              | `hasDaylightSaving(timeZone)`          | Zone-level, no instant                               |
| Where do this zone's transitions fall?                                          | `getDstTransitions(timeZone, year)`    | Enumerates instants                                  |
| Is _this particular instant_ currently in DST?                                  | `isInDaylightSaving(value)`            | A single zoned value                                 |
| What should happen when construction lands on an ambiguous/nonexistent instant? | `disambiguation` / `offset` (this doc) | Orthogonal — a construction-time choice, not a query |

`isInDaylightSaving` compares a zoned value's own offset against its timeZone's standard (non-DST) offset for that same year — the smaller of the offsets a Jan 15 and a Jul 15 reference point attain, since DST always shifts a zone's clocks forward relative to its own standard time, in every hemisphere:

```typescript
import { isInDaylightSaving } from "@northguild/gmt/zoned";

isInDaylightSaving("2024-07-15T12:00:00-04:00[America/New_York]");
// true

isInDaylightSaving("2024-01-15T12:00:00-05:00[America/New_York]");
// false

// Southern-hemisphere DST spans the new year — one of the two reference
// points still falls in standard time and the other in DST either way.
isInDaylightSaving("2024-01-15T12:00:00+11:00[Australia/Sydney]");
// true

isInDaylightSaving("2024-07-15T12:00:00+09:00[Asia/Tokyo]");
// false — Asia/Tokyo has no DST, so this is always false
```

## Which function do I actually need?

`disambiguation` shows up on more than one function, and they don't all behave the same way — this is the part people get tripped up on. Use this table to route to the right one:

| Your situation                                | Function                          | Real control?                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Attach a plain local time + timezone          | `convertPlainDateTimeToZoned`     | **Yes, fully.**                |
| Add/subtract a duration from a zoned datetime | `addZoned` / `subtractZoned`      | **Overlaps only.**             |
| Jump to start/end of a boundary               | `startOfZoned` family             | **Yes — if `offset` default.** |
| Set one or more fields directly               | `setZoned` / `setUnix` / `setUtc` | **Yes — if `offset` default.** |
| Cycle (wrap) a single field                   | `cycleZoned`                      | **Yes — if `offset` default.** |

- **`convertPlainDateTimeToZoned`** — every value (`earlier`/`later`/`reject`) changes the result, for both gaps and overlaps.
- **`addZoned` / `subtractZoned`** — only controls overlaps; has no effect on gaps. See below.
- **`startOfZoned` family** (`startOfZoned`, `endOfZoned`, `startOfQuarterForZoned`, `endOfQuarterForZoned`, `mapZonedHoursInDay`, and their `unix/` counterparts `startOfUnix`, `endOfUnix`, `startOfQuarterForUnix`, `endOfQuarterForUnix` — Story C3) — fully controllable; these construct a new local time via `.with()`, same mechanism as `convertPlainDateTimeToZoned` — **but see "The `offset` parameter" below**, since `.with()` has an extra option that `.from()` doesn't need to worry about.
- **`setZoned` / `setUnix` / `setUtc`** (Story J1) — also `.with()`-based, same rule as the `startOfZoned` family: leave `offset` at its default (`"ignore"`) for `disambiguation` to take effect. Unlike `startOfZoned`'s fixed reset values (`day: 1`, `hour: 0`, ...), these take **caller-supplied** field values, so they also expose `overflow` — a fixed literal like `day: 1` can never be out of range, but a caller-supplied `day: 31` can be. `setUtc`'s `disambiguation`/`offset` are accepted for signature consistency but are permanently inert: `"UTC"` has no DST transitions.
- **`cycleZoned`** (Story E6) — same `.with()`-based rule as `setZoned`: leave `offset` at its default (`"ignore"`) for `disambiguation` to take effect. `cycleZoned` computes its target field value with plain, DST-agnostic wrap bounds (e.g. `hour` always wraps `0–23`), then hands it to `setZoned` — so a cycled `hour` that lands in a gap or overlap is resolved by `disambiguation`/`offset` exactly the way any other field-set call is, rather than by deriving DST-aware wrap boundaries directly.

### Real-world scenarios

**"A user picks 2:30 AM on March 10th in a signup form, and I need to store it as a real instant."**
You have a _plain_ local time with no instant behind it yet — use `convertPlainDateTimeToZoned`. That date/time might not exist (spring-forward gap), and `disambiguation` is your only lever to decide what happens: silently round forward (`"compatible"`/`"later"`), silently round back (`"earlier"`), or make it a hard validation error (`"reject"`) so the form can ask the user to pick a different time.

**"A subscription renews every 30 days from whenever it started, and I need the next renewal timestamp."**
You already have a `ZonedDateTime` (the last renewal) and you're moving it forward by a duration — use `addZoned`. Here `disambiguation` only matters if the _arithmetic result itself_ happens to land on an ambiguous fall-back local time (e.g. the 30-day cycle happens to land on `2024-11-03T01:30:00` in `America/New_York`); you can pass `disambiguation: "reject"` to catch that and force a manual decision instead of silently picking `"compatible"`. But if the result instead lands in a _gap_ (nonexistent local time), `disambiguation` won't help — Temporal's arithmetic already resolves gap landings on its own, before `addZoned` ever gets a chance to apply your preference. Don't rely on `reject` to catch a gap-crossing add; it won't throw.

**"I need to reject any zoned arithmetic that lands on DST-ambiguous ground, no exceptions."**
You can get there for overlaps (pass `disambiguation: "reject"` to `addZoned`/`subtractZoned`), but not for gaps — there's currently no way to make a gap-crossing add/subtract fail. If that guarantee matters for your domain, validate the _result_ separately (e.g. reconstruct it through `convertPlainDateTimeToZoned` with `reject`, which does see gaps) rather than trusting `addZoned` alone.

### Why `addZoned`/`subtractZoned` can't fully control gaps

`Temporal.ZonedDateTime.prototype.add()`/`.subtract()` don't accept a `disambiguation` option at all — arithmetic always resolves ambiguity internally as `"compatible"`. GMT's `addZoned`/`subtractZoned` work around this by re-resolving the _result_ through the same construction path `convertPlainDateTimeToZoned` uses (dropping the offset and reconstructing from the local time + timezone). That trick genuinely works for overlaps, because the ambiguity is still there to resolve when you look at the result's local time. It does _not_ work for gaps: by the time arithmetic finishes, a gap landing has already been silently advanced past (the local time it hands back is a real, unambiguous one) — there's nothing left to disambiguate. This is a property of how Temporal's arithmetic algorithm works, not a GMT limitation we can lift later without an upstream spec change.

### The `offset` parameter

The `startOfZoned` family (Story C3) constructs its boundary via `Temporal.ZonedDateTime.prototype.with()`, not `.from()`. `.with()` has an option `convertPlainDateTimeToZoned`/`addZoned`/`subtractZoned` never need to think about, because they don't have it: **`offset`**, which controls what happens to the _existing_ offset already attached to the source `ZonedDateTime` when you change some of its fields.

`offset` accepts four values, mirroring Temporal's own `OffsetDisambiguationOptions`:

| Value                                          | Behavior                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"prefer"` (Temporal's default)                | Keep the source's offset if it's still valid for the new fields; only fall back to `disambiguation` if it isn't.                                |
| `"use"`                                        | Always keep the source's offset, even if that produces a different real-world instant than the local time implies.                              |
| `"ignore"` (**GMT's default for this family**) | Always discard the source's offset and recompute purely from time zone + local time — this is what makes `disambiguation` actually take effect. |
| `"reject"`                                     | Throw if the source's offset isn't valid for the new fields, regardless of `disambiguation`.                                                    |

**Why this matters, concretely**: every function in the `startOfZoned` family starts from an already-built `ZonedDateTime` — which already has a valid, resolved offset — and then resets some of its fields (e.g. zeroing the minutes for "start of hour"). For a same-day field reset, the source's offset is _almost always still valid_ for the new fields. With `offset: "prefer"` (Temporal's default), that means the source offset just gets kept — and `disambiguation` is never even consulted, because there was nothing ambiguous to resolve from Temporal's point of view. This was discovered empirically while wiring up `disambiguation` on these functions: passing `disambiguation` alone (matching the pattern used by `convertPlainDateTimeToZoned`) produced byte-identical output across all four values on a real fall-back-overlap case, until `offset: "ignore"` was also passed.

GMT defaults `offset` to `"ignore"` on every function in this family, specifically so that `disambiguation` works the way you'd expect out of the box. You only need to touch `offset` if you deliberately want Temporal's raw `.with()` semantics (e.g. "keep whatever offset this ZonedDateTime already had, even across a boundary jump") — and if you do, know that setting it away from `"ignore"` can make `disambiguation` silently do nothing, exactly like the bug described above.

```typescript
import { startOfZoned } from "@northguild/gmt/zoned";

// 2024-11-03T01:45:00-05:00 is the SECOND, repeated 1am of the fall-back overlap in America/New_York.
const source = "2024-11-03T01:45:00-05:00[America/New_York]";

startOfZoned(source, "hour", { disambiguation: "reject" });
// "" — offset defaults to "ignore", so disambiguation actually fires and "reject" throws

startOfZoned(source, "hour", { disambiguation: "reject", offset: "prefer" });
// "2024-11-03T01:00:00-05:00[America/New_York]" — offset:"prefer" keeps the source's
// still-valid -05:00 offset, so disambiguation is never consulted and "reject" never fires
```

`convertPlainDateTimeToZoned` and `addZoned`/`subtractZoned` also accept an `offset` parameter (for API consistency across the disambiguation-aware functions), but it's **permanently inert** on both: their underlying `.from()` call always parses a plain datetime string with no offset embedded in the first place, so there's never a stored offset for `offset` to prefer/use/ignore/reject against. `disambiguation` alone fully controls those two.

**Why not `overflow` too?** `Temporal.ZonedDateTime.prototype.with()` also accepts a third option, `overflow` (`"constrain" | "reject"`, controlling what happens when a field value like `day` or `month` is out of range). GMT deliberately doesn't expose it: every field value these functions pass to `.with()` is a fixed, always-in-range literal (`day: 1`, `hour: 0`, `hour: 23`, `nanosecond: 999`, and so on), so `overflow` can never actually branch at any call site in this library today. Exposing it would just be a documented no-op, so it's left off the public API.

## Using it in GMT

`convertPlainDateTimeToZoned` (and, as the DST disambiguation work continues, other functions that produce a `ZonedDateTime` from a plain/local value) accepts an optional `disambiguation` option:

```typescript
import { convertPlainDateTimeToZoned } from "@northguild/gmt/zoned";

// Spring-forward gap: 2024-03-10T02:30:00 doesn't exist in America/New_York.
convertPlainDateTimeToZoned("2024-03-10T02:30:00", "America/New_York");
// "2024-03-10T03:30:00.000-04:00[America/New_York]"  (default "compatible" == "later")

convertPlainDateTimeToZoned("2024-03-10T02:30:00", "America/New_York", {
  disambiguation: "earlier",
});
// "2024-03-10T01:30:00.000-05:00[America/New_York]"

convertPlainDateTimeToZoned("2024-03-10T02:30:00", "America/New_York", {
  disambiguation: "reject",
});
// "" — no such local time exists, and we're not going to guess

// Fall-back overlap: 2024-11-03T01:30:00 happens twice in America/New_York.
convertPlainDateTimeToZoned("2024-11-03T01:30:00", "America/New_York");
// "2024-11-03T01:30:00.000-04:00[America/New_York]"  (default "compatible" == "earlier")

convertPlainDateTimeToZoned("2024-11-03T01:30:00", "America/New_York", {
  disambiguation: "later",
});
// "2024-11-03T01:30:00.000-05:00[America/New_York]"
```

Note the offset is what actually distinguishes the two fall-back results above — the wall-clock string looks identical (`01:30:00`), but `-04:00` vs. `-05:00` is a real one-hour difference in absolute time.

## Why this matters

Silently resolving DST ambiguity is a well-known source of subtle bugs — a scheduled job, calendar event, or reminder created "at 2:30 AM" near a DST boundary can land an hour off from what the user meant, and it only shows up twice a year, making it hard to catch in testing. Exposing `disambiguation` explicitly means:

- You can pick a default behavior once, consciously and consistently, instead of inheriting whatever Temporal happens to do.
- You can use `"reject"` to make DST-ambiguous input an explicit validation failure at the boundary of your system, rather than a silently-wrong timestamp downstream.
