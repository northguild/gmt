# @northguild/gmt-eslint

## 1.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 2945c76: Add `repository`, `homepage`, and `bugs` metadata to the Biome and ESLint config packages, matching `gmt` and `gmt-oxlint`. npm requires a public `repository` field matching the publishing source in order to generate a provenance attestation, and the automated release workflow publishes via npm trusted publishing, which generates provenance for every public package automatically. Without these fields the two packages could not be published by CI. Also surfaces a repo and issues link on their npm pages.

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- e0b3c6e: Publish packages under the `@northguild` npm org, replacing the retired `@burglekitt` scope.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 131087a: Add deprecation notice: this package is moving to `@northguild/gmt-eslint` under the [northguild](https://github.com/northguild) GitHub organization. `@northguild/gmt-eslint` will receive no further updates after this release.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Nest skill frontmatter fields (`library_version`, etc.) under `metadata:` to match the Intent ≥0.1 schema. The previously published skill files used the older flat frontmatter and fail validation under current `@tanstack/intent` versions. No skill content or lint rule behavior changes.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- c064e99: Rewrite lint rule messages to remove informal "Aint nobody got time for..." phrasing in favor of direct, professional wording. No rule behavior changes — only the emitted message text.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- fa5a465: Initial public release of the gmt suite.

  ## @northguild/gmt

  Temporal-first date and time library. String-in, string-out API wrapping
  `@js-temporal/polyfill`. Covers plain and zoned arithmetic, comparison,
  formatting, parsing, mapping, conversion, and validation. No `Date` object
  used anywhere.

  ## @northguild/gmt-eslint

  ESLint flat-config plugin that bans the `Date` API (`new Date`, `Date.now`,
  `Date.UTC`, `Date.parse`, and the global `Date` reference) and points
  consumers toward `@northguild/gmt` replacements.

  ## @northguild/gmt-oxlint

  Oxlint JS plugin with the same `Date`-ban policy as `gmt-eslint`. Rules
  cover `new Date`, `Date.now`, `Date.UTC`, `Date.parse`,
  `date.getTimezoneOffset`, and bare `Date` global references.

  ## @northguild/gmt-biome

  Biome GritQL plugin enforcing the same `Date`-ban rules for projects using
  Biome as their formatter/linter.
