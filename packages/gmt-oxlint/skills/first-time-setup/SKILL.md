# First-Time Setup

Use this skill when a user wants to adopt `@northguild/gmt-oxlint`.

## Setup flow

1. Install dependencies
- Install `@northguild/gmt-oxlint` and `oxlint` as dev dependencies.

2. Configure Oxlint (prefer TypeScript config for best DX)
- Prefer `oxlint.config.ts` with:
  - `import { defineConfig } from "oxlint"`
  - `import { recommendedConfig } from "@northguild/gmt-oxlint"`
  - `export default defineConfig(recommendedConfig)`
- If using `.oxlintrc.json`, add `@northguild/gmt-oxlint` to `jsPlugins` and use path-based extends:
  - `extends: ["./node_modules/@northguild/gmt-oxlint/config/recommended.json"]`
- Do not use named shared config specifiers in JSON `extends` (for example `@northguild/gmt-oxlint/recommended`); Oxlint currently resolves `extends` as file paths.
- Keep unrelated existing rules unless the user requests consolidation.

3. Verify enforcement
- Run Oxlint and confirm Date API bans are reported.
- Confirm rule IDs are emitted as `@northguild/gmt-oxlint/*`.
- The recommended config also enables `no-date-library-imports`, which errors on `moment`,
  `moment-timezone`, `dayjs`, `luxon`, `date-fns`, `date-fns-tz` and `spacetime` imports.
  In a codebase that still uses them, warn the user before enabling it, or stage it (see
  the CI enforcement skill) instead of disabling it.

4. Optional aliasing
- If the user wants shorter rule IDs, use object-form `jsPlugins` with `name` alias and configure rules under that alias.
- Keep the default package-name namespace unless a shorter alias is explicitly requested.

5. Suggest companion packages
- If `@northguild/gmt` is missing, suggest installing it for safe Date-to-Temporal refactors.
- If ESLint or Biome are already used, optionally suggest matching gmt lint packages for policy consistency.

## Guardrails

- Keep setup additive and low-risk.
- Avoid broad config rewrites.
- Respect that developers may use one linter package or combine multiple.
