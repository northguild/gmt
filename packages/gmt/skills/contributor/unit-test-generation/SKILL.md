# Unit Test Generation

Use this skill when writing or updating tests for `packages/gmt/src/*` methods.

## Required patterns

1. Use `it.each` template literals for iterative tests.
2. Use fake timers for now-dependent behavior.
3. Never override real runtime functions directly.
4. Validate type-specific fallback behavior on invalid input.
5. For locale-aware methods, include the required locale matrix explicitly.

## Test checklist

1. Happy path
- Verify expected output for representative valid inputs.

2. Invalid input path
- String-returning method returns `""`.
- Number-returning method returns `null`.
- Boolean-returning method returns `false`.

 - Tests should assert the strict input contract: only ISO 8601 strings, IANA timezone identifiers, or explicit unix epoch numbers are accepted by public APIs. When inputs are outside these shapes, assert the library's typed fallbacks are returned rather than relying on permissive parsing.


3. Boundary path
- Include leap day and month rollover scenarios.
- For zoned behavior, include DST or offset-sensitive scenarios.

4. Locale path
- For locale-aware APIs, include explicit `MustTestLocales.*` rows.

## Timer and mocking policy

1. Use `vi.useFakeTimers()` and `vi.setSystemTime(...)`.
2. Restore with `vi.useRealTimers()`.
3. Use `vi.spyOn(...).mockReturnValue(...)` style APIs when stubbing.
4. Do not monkey-patch globals or Temporal internals.

## Quality bar for new custom methods

When a new method is added because no gmt method exists:

1. Add strong tests in the same PR.
2. Cover happy path, invalid path, and boundary path.
3. Prefer explicit table-driven tests over ad hoc single-case tests.
