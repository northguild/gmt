/**
 * Compute the wrapped (or rounded) target value for one field of a `cycle*` call.
 *
 * - `bounds: null` means the field is unbounded (only `year` uses this) — cycling is plain
 *   addition, and rounding still snaps to a multiple of `amount` with no wrap correction.
 * - Non-round path is modulo arithmetic relative to `bounds.min`, so it resolves any `amount` —
 *   including one bigger than the field's own range (e.g. cycling month by +13) — in one step,
 *   not by repeatedly correcting a single overflow.
 * - Round path is **not** "round to nearest": it steps by `Math.sign(amount)` first, then snaps to
 *   the next multiple of `Math.abs(amount)` in the direction of that sign (ceiling for positive
 *   amounts, floor for negative). Multiples are relative to `0`, not `bounds.min`. GMT's own
 *   rule, not a standard's: a cycle always moves the way `amount` points, and the nearest
 *   multiple can lie the other way — e.g. minute `22` cycled by `+15` with `round: true` lands on
 *   `30` (the next multiple of 15 above 22), not `15` (the nearest multiple).
 * - Comparison: `@internationalized/date`'s `CycleOptions.round` rounds a bounded field the same
 *   way.
 *
 * @param current the field's current numeric value
 * @param amount signed amount to cycle by
 * @param bounds inclusive `{ min, max }` range to wrap within, or `null` for unbounded
 * @param round whether to snap to the next/previous multiple of `amount` instead of adding it
 * @example cycleFieldValue(12, 1, { min: 1, max: 12 }, false) // 1 (month December +1 wraps to January)
 * @example cycleFieldValue(1, 13, { min: 1, max: 12 }, false) // 2 (amount larger than the range)
 * @example cycleFieldValue(22, 15, { min: 0, max: 59 }, true) // 30 (next multiple of 15 above 22)
 * @example cycleFieldValue(22, -15, { min: 0, max: 59 }, true) // 15 (previous multiple of 15 below 22)
 * @example cycleFieldValue(2022, 5, null, true) // 2025 (unbounded field, still rounds)
 * @returns the new field value
