/**
 * Join a relative day label (e.g. "Tomorrow") with the localized time-of-day
 * for the same instant, using the locale's *own* connector word/punctuation
 * instead of a hardcoded one (e.g. English "at").
 *
 * - Formats `epochMilliseconds` with `dateStyle: "full"` + `timeStyle` to get
 *   CLDR's locale-correct date/time part sequence and its connector, then
 *   discards every date-labeled part (weekday/era/year/month/day) in favor of
 *   `dayLabel` — keeping only the connector and the time-side parts.
 * - The connector is whatever literal part immediately follows the last
 *   date-labeled part — a space for locales with none (e.g. tr-TR), a word
 *   for others (" at " / " um " / " à " / "في " / …). This works for every
 *   locale because it reads CLDR's own combined-pattern output rather than
 *   assuming a fixed word or position.
 * - This is why the day/time split cannot be done by formatting the date and
 *   time halves separately and concatenating with a hardcoded joiner: the
 *   joiner itself, and even the ordering of the day-period relative to the
 *   hour (see ko-KR/zh-TW, where "PM" precedes the hour), are locale-specific
 *   and only `Intl` knows them.
 * - One further wrinkle: some locales' date pattern has its own trailing
 *   literal glued onto the last date field, unrelated to the date/time
 *   connector — ru-RU renders a bare date as "15 марта 2024 г." (a genitive
 *   "year" marker suffixed to the year number with no separating space), so
 *   the combined format's literal after "2024" is " г. в " (suffix + real
 *   connector, fused into one part). A second `dateStyle`-only format call
 *   below detects and strips that date-side suffix before treating the rest
 *   of the literal as the connector — otherwise "г." would leak into
 *   "tomorrow г. at 2:30", nonsensical since it isn't attached to a year here.
 *
 * @param epochMilliseconds instant to format, in milliseconds since the Unix epoch
 * @param timeZone IANA timezone identifier (or "UTC" for plain values with no real zone)
 * @param locale optional BCP 47 locale tag
 * @param dayLabel the word/phrase replacing the date half (e.g. "Tomorrow", "Friday")
 * @param timeStyle Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions `timeStyle` for the time half
 * @returns `dayLabel` joined to the localized time with the locale's own connector
