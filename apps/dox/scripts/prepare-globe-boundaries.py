"""
One-shot data-prep for the DOX-E1a globe's timezone-boundary demarcation.

This script is NOT part of the dox build pipeline. Run it manually when the
upstream `timezone-boundary-builder` dataset is updated and you want to refresh
`apps/dox/public/timezone-boundaries-globe.json`.

Unlike `prepare-timezone-boundaries.py` (which keeps only the 10 CI-matrix zones
at high fidelity for the flat `TimezoneMap`), this keeps *every* zone but
simplifies hard — the globe renders at a few hundred CSS pixels and spins, so
~0.2 degree (~22 km) polygons read as clean borders while keeping the asset
small enough to fetch lazily after the globe is already interactive.

Steps:
  1. Download the latest `timezones.geojson.zip` release from
     https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder
  2. Simplify every polygon with shapely at SIMPLIFY_TOLERANCE_DEG,
     preserving topology.
  3. Write a compact FeatureCollection of `{ properties: { tzid }, geometry }`
     to apps/dox/public/timezone-boundaries-globe.json

The globe maps IANA ids to these `tzid` values verbatim, except `UTC` -> `Etc/UTC`
(the dataset uses the latter). Zones with no boundary polygon simply get no
demarcation outline; the globe still plots and clocks them.

Requires: `uv run --with shapely python scripts/prepare-globe-boundaries.py`
(or any venv with shapely installed). tzdb / the boundary builder release
several times a year — this is not a one-time import.

    Two fixes:
      * **Winding.** d3-geo's convention is the *opposite* of GeoJSON's — it
        wants clockwise exterior rings (same as `world-atlas`). The upstream
        dataset mixes both windings, and shapely's `simplify()` does not
        preserve orientation, so a wrongly-wound ring makes d3 fill the whole
        visible hemisphere. `orient(..., sign=-1.0)` forces CW exteriors.
      * **Slivers.** Simplifying at ~0.2 deg collapses tiny exclaves to
        near-zero-area triangles; drop them.
