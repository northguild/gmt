 *   - src/content/docs/guides/concepts/dst-disambiguation.md — copied from
 *     docs/dst-disambiguation.md (the single canonical source), with
 *     Starlight frontmatter prepended and the `## Further reading` link
 *     rewritten to point at the guides index.
 *
 * Run as: node apps/dox/scripts/build-guides.mjs
 *
 * The emitted `.md` is gitignored; the canonical source stays
 * docs/dst-disambiguation.md.
