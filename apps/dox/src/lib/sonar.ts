/**
 * Re-fire the shared sonar focus ping when an already-focused control is
 * activated again.
 *
 * The ping is a CSS animation on the `:focus` rule (`@keyframes gmt-focus-sonar`
 * / `gmt-tab-sonar`, gmt-primitives.css + gmt-content.css) and runs a single
 * iteration. That covers the common case — focus lands, the ring pings out once
 * — but a second click on a control that never lost focus produces no new
 * `:focus` transition, so the animation would not replay. This listener spots
 * that case and restarts it.
 *
 * The first ping is still the stylesheet's job; this only ever *re*-triggers.
